1,7500750,iphone7,After 15 odd years of iphones have moved away to a Huawei P9. Best move I ever made. As a professional photographer the Leica Camera is brilliant. The Battery life is excellent. It is fast & efficient as well. Being able to re-arrange my main screen they way I want  is awesome. ,
2,5575056,iphone7,do not buy edge phones because u can't hold properly. if u touch side edge other applications will open.( one by one). (experienced person.,
3,8369316,iphone7,People are getting to personal about this.At the end od the day its just a phone. Every article has its price if you dont have the money just dont buy it.I love this phone and loved the S6 edge+ I had before it and the lumia 930 before the Sams.Just enjoy your choice and dont judge others.,
4,6062345,iphone7,Why apple seems perfect ? Because it has its own hardware which is paired to its own operating system powered by its own chipset. Nothing wrong in this with very limited features compared to android.Now android which is developed by google and companies redeisgn it to pair it with their hardware and using some third party chipset but with no limitationssometimes the pairing gets perfect and sometimes not. But anyway iphone gives better customer service that is good.,
5,2928206,iphone7,Yes no objection in that but iphone freaks wont agree.,

13,1951372,iphone7,I bought iphone 7 128GB yesterday and i had iphone 6s 64GB i must say display is better speakers is way better battery is not i hope that is becouse i didn't calibrate battery yet camera is better in low light especially but in good condition is much sharper and performance...just amazing... i call it with one word...speed i'm use to new fingerprint immediately way better than 6s,
14,4289206,iphone7,iOS 10.1.1 run battery fast pls fix this issue immediately.l still believe Sony it still the best it does lag move smoothly good picturesgood sound.,
15,2796173,iphone7,Nearly every phone has Sony sensor. I think they have a market share of 80% at phone camera sensors. Why shouldn't Apple use them then? Even half of S7 (edge) have sony sensor although they also have an own sensor. LG G5 has Sony. Xperia XZ has Sony. HTC 10 has Sony. OnePlus 3 has Sony. Mi5 has Sony. ,
16,7053880,iphone7,Because Sony paid him to use Xperia.,
17,4898989,iphone7,I have iPad mini 3 with same chipset. I never have lag or sometimes very slightly. If you say it has heavy lag on lastest firmware you lie.,

20,6911522,iphone7,No problem using this phone even if u had switched to apple from android.All contacts come back easily. All u have to do is to install gmail and sign into it. It is worth buying.,
21,5209266,iphone7,Maybe a good product but be warned. Weird company this Apple with unique shortcomings for which they dont have/ don't want to give an answer. My iPhone6 charges only when switched off doesn't charge when on even with Apple original cables. Apple doesn't seem to have an answer for this/ doesn't want to give a solution for this. Cannot understand this attitude. And people yet rave about Apple. Tried all possible suggestions from the internet and Apple servuce centre visit prior to that. Anyone with a solution?,
22,5914278,iphone7,Definately buy iPhone 7,
23,7737105,iphone7,HTC 10 was a good phone. Only disadvantage was the veeery slow storage which slows down the whole phone notable especially at opening games and transferring data. But the iPhone 7 is just newer and better so I would choose it.,
24,3305554,iphone7,htc's technical support is good? some people don't recommend at all. i have to make decision between htc 10 and iphone 7. which one do you recommend? i am very undecided guys please help me.,
25,6165469,iphone7,This is most popular phone after the iphone 7 plus. This phone has really awesome specification but one star less because its screen is small.,
26,5163429,iphone7,There is more passion about iphone in youngsters you can see this passion when phone was released there were thousand of peoples who were waiting for buy new iphone 7 plus.,
27,7408911,iphone7,Super excited after using it for a month.Its awesome and brilliant. The camera is stupendously amazing.....The screen could have been larger and a memory card slot should be there....,
28,1160491,iphone7,Great product. Excellent service by Amazon,
29,4567531,iphone7,Very small phone disappointed by the screen don't purchase this phone useless instead of this go for Google pixel.,
30,1085218,iphone7,I'm frustrated with the screen size apple is giving,
31,4781313,iphone7,Ugh..So horrible. What a bad mistake I made. No Headphone jack slow read/write speed of 32 GB variant. Should have gone for Galaxy S7 edge V20 or something else.,
32,7065999,iphone7,Actualy i cant say anything more than AWESOME.They have done it again this is an amazing phone,
33,4122919,iphone7,Excellent speed of processor !!! Sleek design!!! I'm happy with iPhone 7.,
34,6234377,iphone7,I have 70000 so frnds suggested me to buy iPhone 7........later I decided to buy with that money moto g4 plus....I bought it...with rest 55000 I bought activa 3g.....moblie was awsome and bike was superb.,
35,4598881,iphone7,its my 1st iPhone and its an iPhone 7.Purchasing it was a dream which came true on this diwali. Thank u amazon for this superb phone. Its camera is class apart.. no one is near to this..,
36,6420328,iphone7,Great stereo speakers as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy. Home button is no longer a physical button now so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.,
37,4828637,iphone7,Cost is not matching with design & specification.,
38,2037851,iphone7,most worst phone i have ever seen woth such high cost i get a google pixal or samsung s7edge at same price range ppl who buy it may take it just to show off.,
39,1578405,iphone7,I WAS LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF THE PRODUCT GENUINENESS AS MY ORDER WAS LITTLE COSTLY  BUT NOW I AM 100 % CONFIDENT AND HAPPY ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT. EACH AND EVERY THING IS GREAT THE FASTNESS OF DELIVERY TIME TO TIME MESSAGE UPDATES AND FINALLY THE APP.,
40,8276508,iphone7,The moment you hold the phone in your hand you feel vowits amazing.,
41,2392069,iphone7,Camera is awesomespeed is fabulous.,
42,2115060,iphone7,It is an awesome phonegives an elligant look.i have been using since 1month from a local shop I did not find any such problems. I love the phone.,
43,1255632,iphone7,waste of moneybettere to buy Samsung phones insteadIphones are worst IPhone 6 had only 1gb ramiphone 7 -2gb ram and iphon 7 plus has 3gb ram.Better to buyope plus 3 at Rs 30000 with 6 gb ram.Fully satisfiedVery powerful phone in this world.,
44,4879380,iphone7,Right from the embellished looks this handset is blazingly fast in all rigorous tests performed. Home button redo is more responsive and durable. Privacy is flawless in IOS Siri is getting more intelligent I was surprised hearing “By the way I don’t know how to say it will you teach me?”Battery takes exactly 2 hours for 95% charge and it would sustain between 8-10 hours with 4-5 hours calling and moderate 4G usage. Apple could have reinforced at least 2300 mAH in this price. Sound quality is elevated with stereo speakers can hear bass punches but treble is emphasized slightly. Apple kept the laxity consistent towards screen-to-body ratio with mediocre 65.6%. Headphone jack is obliterated perhaps sooner than the appropriate time. Sound perfectionists with expensive wired headsets now are on mercy of carrying the adaptor everywhere. No wireless earpods with the box for your information.There are two variants of iPhone 7 models A1778 with Intel and A1660 with Qualcomm chipset in modem for signal reception. Lot of reviews advise Qualcomm is better with latest LTE bands compatibility and signal reception, but the model A1660 is available only in US. India has A1778 model and that is point of anxiety only if you plan to use the handset in US and with Sprint or Verizon carriers. I did some checks near dead spots with iPhone 7 6s and 5s (in India) and nowhere A1778 showed major difference than 5s and 6s. The calls and signal strength was almost identical you could do same tests in elevators or in other dead spots.
45,9827255,iphone7,I love this cell phone.,
46,6314368,iphone7,I can buy this phone but many things is on subscribtion like iTunes and etc and mostly apps can use internet it's not good about airpods it's sound quality is awesome but its easily misplace in useing in comparison of 6s & 7 6s is good to use.,
47,9691804,iphone7,waste of money.,
48,6806872,iphone7,Excellent !,
49,3062624,iphone7,I have used a s7 edge before I bought a iPhone from local dealerI was very impressed by audio quality in s7 and have heard Samsung put a lucky chip for audio which improved the sound wearing headfones very much better than s6.After listening to my music on iPhone 7 I found it outclassed all Samsung flagship models especially when listening to music over iphone speakersworldif picture colour accuracy is what u like iPhone beats all mobiles although the screen resolution is less than s7edge which so more vibrant and being bigger 5.5 more beautiful to beholds7 edge is an all round device which gives you the total money's worthif u r mainly interested in listening to music with two speakers which is little better than all Samsung devices buy iPhone or buy an s7 or edge which will save your money and give u an all round fantastic exp,
50,9062944,iphone7,"Camera quality is good but not pretty much.The iPhone 7 is now fully water-resistant (it can take a shallow dunking).The camera takes notably better photos especially in low light and adds the optical image stabilization feature previously restricted to the 5.5-inch Plus model.The battery lasts longer -- probably a couple of hours or more a day under normal usage. (We'll update this review after we test the battery in our lab.)The processor is faster although you might only notice the speed on some intensive games and the video and photo-editing apps.It's also got a ""wide color gamut"" screen with enhanced color accuracy and enhanced stereo speakers though I didn't find those improvements as critical as the ones above. And the home button isn't ""clickable"" anymore -- it uses the same pressure sensitivity and vibration feedback found on the 3D Touch screen. It works perfectly well but takes some getting used to because there's no mechanical click when you press the home button.",
51,9677404,iphone7,The speakers sound louder. They surround the left and right sides of the iPhone now instead of a single speaker down by the home button. It's better for casual game playing or movie watching but I'd take headphones every time. Or if I was sharing with someone I'd pick a larger screen. They don't always sound as defined and crisp as I'd like.,
52,6483121,iphone7,The display is still a bit difficult to view in direct sunlight.,
53,9000160,iphone7,"The best improvement of all might be haptics: the vibrations or rumbles or taps or throbs the phone makes in response to your actions. Apple updated the ""Taptic Engine"" in the iPhone 7 which makes all the vibrations seem sharper and more defined. The silence mode is now a quick tip-tap. Pushing in on 3D Touch icons (if you even do that) throbs more readily. Some sounds and settings now come with phone-rumbling enhancements. Change the clock time feel the click of the wheel as you spin it. It means that more tactile feedback is possible even in apps with onscreen buttons. It's like a phone-wide Xbox One rumble pack.",
54,7259995,iphone7,Battery backup is poor as compared to any chinese phone or samsung..phone hangs sometimes. rest everything is same what iphone is known for... big disappointment.,
55,4068440,iphone7,Very good product. Delivery could have been improved specially when you buy such an expensive product. Overall very happy with everything. No complaints. Thanks apple.,
56,6024582,iphone7,Such a great phone. I'm loving it. Black looks elegant and smooth. Im new to iOS and its damn cool.,
57,9379999,iphone7,The above feedback was after 3 days of use. This is my 8th days with iPhone 7 and guess what my iPhone 7 doesn't get unlock. Touch id hangs and doesn't respond. passcode doesn't work. I can just watch my home screen and play with live photo screen saver.....Got an appointment with the service center and not sure whats going to happen (fingers crossed). This is my first apple product and my experience sucks. Paying 70K for a phone and this kind of experience make you rethink of all the negative feedbacks i had seen which Amazon deleted purposefully.,
58,5327635,iphone7,This is awesome,
59,9165186,iphone7,Head phone supplied with the iphone7 was not the wireless airpode head phone one described. I was supplied with an ordinary head phone. Main attraction is defeated. My complaint is pending without any reply.,
60,6828155,iphone7,I was very much excited to buy first Apple product and had planned long back to buy an iPhone.Just loved the product and features.Camera is amazing and phone is faster than an android phone.I would have given 5 stars if the phone was delievered on time by amazon.,
61,6552308,iphone7,I bought this product from local Apple authorised store and this is what I feel after using it for almost 15 days now.,
62,2853361,iphone7,They say it has superior hardware like better processorcamera and battery life with additional features like waterproof and dust proof compared to IPhone 6s. Practically it makes no differerence at all except for camera. Any application you run in iPhone 7 and IPhone 6s takes same time and also same time to copy files etc. What is the meaning of superior hardware if it makes no difference compared to its predecessors?,
63,9849834,iphone7,This hardware etc. is just selling point of this phone as its battery life is same as IPhone 6s too.,
64,2806539,iphone7,If you are upgrading from iPhone 5s or 6 to Iphone 7 then it could be worth but if you are upgrading from 6s then it is completely waste of money. For IPhone 6s/plus users I say wait for Iphone 7s.,
65,4390253,iphone7,No doubt the best! Runs smoothly.,
66,1875587,iphone7,Apple's latest iPhones are here. The all-new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus boasts of a faster processor better camera bigger battery and host of other additions.The smartphones have received mixed review from analysts. While some are impressed others really are not.You wondering if you should shell out big bucks (price starts at Rs 60000 in India) for buying the new iPhones? Here are six reasons why you can give them a miss.No major difference in design2/7Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sport the same design as their predecessors -- iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. In fact it is also the same design as that of the two-year old iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models.There are some minor changes like the new handset has stereo speakers at the bottom dual-rear cameras (applicable to iPhone 7 Plus) and antenna lines placed at the sides for a cleaner look -- but as we said really no change to the look and feel.'Almost same' display as iPhone 6S3/7iPhone 7 screen features same Retina HD displayas the one in Apple’s previous-generation handsets (iPhone 6S and iPhone 6s Plus).However Apple claims that the display now offers a wider colour gamut as compared to the duo's standard RGBs display.No major improvements in battery4/7Apple claims that both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with longest-ever battery. However in terms of hours it is two-three hours more for iPhone 7 and one hour more for the iPhone 7 Plusmodel as compared to their predecessors.No headphone jack5/7As widely rumoured Apple has removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from its new iPhone 7 range.This means users won’t be able to use their existing 3.5mm headphones with the new handsets till they use the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter.The smartphone however ships with earpods with Lightning connectors and the adapter.,
67,5985043,iphone7,Phone dead in 7 days...overheats hangs huge network connectivity issues so much so that you miss important mails and messages the phone has capacity to doze off any time....such a waste of time and money.,
68,5359097,iphone7,Awesome new futuristic features with better camera worth to upgrade from 6 to 7 for me.Moreover Amazon prime is amazingdelivered iPhone in just 22 hours after ordering even in,
69,5180244,iphone7,tier II city Indore.,
70,5274558,iphone7,It was good experience.The product was delivered in time .,
71,2246064,iphone7,The phone is super awesome. Very sleek and photo clarity is superb. Headset also rocks. Battery lasts nearly one and half days. Have been using android for quite some years and i can definitely say how stable the ios is including the apps. The touch sensor and taptic engine is tremendously fast and responsive. Camera has stunned me i have been using nexus and one plus so far though i will definitely not say it is better than those phones in terms of quality. But on battery and camera  iphone 7 clearly is winner. Infact a10 processor is super fast. Love every bit of the phone. Happy with the purchase.,
72,8616087,iphone7,The iPhone 7...obviously amazing..super cute..rose pink.,
73,7357434,iphone7,It works like a charm ! Speedy nd great battery life far better then 6s by far the most best battery life on an iPhone ! Overall design is very compact looks handy nd colour is great but jet black looks like a master piece ! Anyways worth buying this phone !,
74,7593151,iphone7,Phone to accessories to packaging the whole experiance is simply out of the world. Its way ahead of anything else on the market. iPhone deserves to be the best every bit.,
75,8672183,iphone7,The new speakers new black colour superfast UI the new home button are things that add to the great experiance.,
76,9349309,iphone7,I was very excited when I pre-ordered my iPhone 7 but the hype gets over from as soon as you turn on the phone. I've been using the Galaxy S6 edge and the iPhone 7 hype made me to buy it but as soon as I turned it on the screen turned my mood off it's really a huge difference down from my 2k dual curved galaxy s6 edge. From then on it kept me disappointing. Just like androids stop holding battery after 2 years and drains too fast it came out of the box with my iPhone blame smaller battery or something else but it drains quickly in normal use.. If you'll use your phone it'll swiftly drain battery which is very Disappointing. Another hype was the fusion chip but you can't really take the full potential of it due to poor fast draining battery and poor gaming experience on this screen as compared to dual edge 2k display of my previous phone. Now if it's just about opening apps faster then I didn't feel difference when I compared it with my s6 edge tho you should press the home button on s6 instead of back button as pressing the back button will restart the app and will take less than half second extra.. Apple didn't care about overall experience and I'm pretty sad with this purchase. It has stereo speakers and you can see speaker holes on both sides of lighting port but it shocked me when I didn't find any sound from one side guess what? The another speaker is embedded in the earpiece.. If you think you'll have loud stereo sound from it then you'll be disappointed again. It has also compromised in headphones sound quality as the output is lower and just 16 not 32 if you know what I mean. I think Apple didn't do much with this smaller version of iPhone 7 but the plus model is insanely heavy so I'll never go for it.. Put it side by side with the year and a half old s6 edge and the latter looks more attractive iphone should be to change design as it's really boring now after 3 years. Thank god my bro accepted to take it as I'll go for and also recommend to wait for S8 but the iPhone 7 is really a failure.,
77,4501947,iphone7,The fingerprint scanner is lightning quick. iOS is smoother than it's ever been. Retina flash works surprisingly well. 3D touch is more useful than I thought it would be. The haptic engine response on the home button does take some time to get used to but now I think it's better than a physical click.,
78,7587815,iphone7,So far no complaints. I find it hilarious that the rating of this phone is destroyed by retards who have never bought/used this phone. Check the verified purchase tag on a review.,
79,2453746,iphone7,This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks unlike me who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt. Honestly as most of the Apple users agree what matters is the design of the phone. If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6 a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand). So if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle. And with Rs.20000 cheaper. I put my chips in there. Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.,
80,2575810,iphone7,Had pre-ordered this phone with a 10k cashback. It was delivered by flipkart around 9:45 PM on 7th Oct on the evening it was launched. Phone was well packed in a mystery black box :-).iPhone 7 is awesome touch screen is awesome. The user experience is far better than those of high end android phones. I don't know what magic does Apple do while making their phones.Getting it in 50k was the best deal I got.,
81,5210948,iphone7,The increased speed and camera are great! 3D Touch feels a little incomplete but is convenient nonetheless. While the design is the same as the 6 the black really makes it stand out. Stunning finish on the matte black.,
82,3915767,iphone7,Iphone 7 in first looks is a awesome phone with great camera. Altogether a new home button which is more faster than previous phones.build quality is very premium with black colour adding further to it.,
83,7415639,iphone7,The volume control button is not working.,
84,9591297,iphone7,The phone - It feels great. I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ,)
85,1742706,iphone7,I was using Iphone-5s and now I have this amazing iphone-7 and yes lot of things have improved.,
86,7861086,iphone7,New taptic engine for main button will take time to adjust other than that no issues.,
87,1262474,iphone7,Brilliant product with super internal specs!!,
88,5269092,iphone7,Firstly flipkart did a fair job on delivering the phone despite the huge number of orders.,
89,7867014,iphone7,Overall iPhone 7 is a nice upgrade from iPhone 6 as I got 3D touch Live photos better camera Better processor Stereo speakers and it's water proof.,
90,6039237,iphone7,But I don't think it has much to offer if you are already using iPhone 6S.,
91,8144651,iphone7,Great phone exceptional camera impeccable delivery and service by Flipkart.,
92,3471411,iphone7,The phone was as expected piece of beauty. The performance is snappy and the resolution is great. For someone who's coming from iPhone 6s this may not be a thing of excitement as it looks 90% just as same. However what has changed is inside of the phone. With better processor camera water resistance technology - a lot has changed inside.,
93,4541098,iphone7,It's another solid performer from the apple stable. The unpacking was made special by flipkart for the preordered ones. I don't want to elaborate as to not ruin the surprise for others. The phone performs effortlessly. Have not had any issues so far. Migrating from an earlier iPhone is quick and simple. Battery life is better than the earlier phones and the new home button beautifully engineered providing an enhanced user experience. I would definitely recommend this phone,
94,1596413,iphone7,Superb phone elegant stylish and classy colour matte black...made a great choice :),
95,9004371,iphone7,Flipkart lived up to its delivery promise which is today the launch day. Overall brilliant! Worth the money spent.,
96,7247763,iphone7,The phone is exactly as described with impeccable build and quality. The new black colour also looks great. Yes it is expensive but with the cash back offers on the pre-order units it worked out to around 5k more than the US price (including taxes). That is the cost I guess for the Indian warranty and peace of mind.,
97,3715670,iphone7,Definitely the best phone available right now. Awesome fast delivery by Flipkart and the seller. iPhone 7 is a must buy if you can afford it. Matte Black looks the best according to me. :),
98,4359496,iphone7,"I pre-ordered my black beauty but I got only yesterday. This is my 3rd iPhone and I must say the wait is worthy and happy with the iPhone. There are many new features which are already described by the others are quite impressive. I always admire the camera & music quality of iPhones and with every phone they only get better! I just taking the slogan form other product but really ""I'm lovin it!! """,
99,8722472,iphone7,The phone is excellent no complaints there. But the experience with Flipkart delivery services was horrible! The shipment was delayed but was never intimated either on email or on call. Starting from the expected delivery date I had to make multiple calls to know the status with not even a single call back or an email update from Flipkart. The agents were continuously making false promises wrt call backs updates etc. but not even a single commitment was met. Overall it was a horrible experience something which I haven't had in any of the earlier engagements with Flipkart!,
100,3279865,iphone7,Again there is great product by Apple. Only one issue with this product is design of headphones. Now the headphones are phone specific because u can't use them with mackbook or elsewhere.,

246,2846598,htc10,Bought this from Qatar in june. Awesome phone no complaints till now. Amazing camera. Speakers and earphones are out of this world. System performs well. Not too stylish but good feel in the hand. Audio and power buttons are tactile. Battery is impressive. My favourite feature is the quickcharge 2.0 enabled charger it gives full charge in around an hour. It has a good UI and nice screen clarity.,
247,9932027,htc10,Overall awesome phone withe just a bit lower in camera quality and screen quality in comaprison to samsung s7.,
248,3701234,htc10,Dont underestimate the power of waste ,
249,6279021,htc10,HTC 10. It more of what you're looking for in a flagship phone. Unparalleled performance. Superb 24-bit Hi-Res sound. The worlds first Optical Image Stabilization in both front and back cameras. And one of the highest smartphone camera rankings ever from DxOMark. All in a beautifully crafted metal unibody.,
250,4735617,htc10,Meet HTC 10. The smartphone crafted with obsession. You get unprecedented control. Off the chart performance. And innovations like the world’s first dual OIS for pro level photos front and back as well as end-to-end 24-bit Hi-Res sound. They are redefining what a flagship phone is truly meant to be. And we really loved the result.,
251,8775573,htc10,Inspiration realized in metal,
252,8687440,htc10,Its the beauty of light crafted into a brand new all-metal unibody. Every element of HTC 10 has been designed refined and perfected. From the bold new chamfered contour to its stunning dual-textured finish and quality construction. All the way down to getting the perfect click from the power button.,
253,4242230,htc10,The phone is a runner up in almost all top ten listing of Android phones.it has premium finish and super packed performance.The best sound quality due to the boomsound technology and the camera is comparable with the top end phones.The only area where it is shadowed is the display.But overall this is the resurrection of htc.hats off to you,
254,7196725,htc10,Its amazing,
255,7729955,htc10,The fingerprint sensor is very reponsive,
256,6464275,htc10,The problem is with the speakers as the volume is very low but overall the phone is the better and the laser focus is better than s7 edge.,
257,9822533,htc10,The size is just perfect.,
258,9672267,htc10,Worth every penny spent on it . Simply superb ... Loved it.,
259,1445579,htc10,Fantastic phone from HTC. Bought it in UAE and using it since May 2016. No lags so far and the phone is very smooth. Hats off to the Hi-Res audio which delivers a studio quality audio on earphones and the display which actually feels amoled though it's not.,
260,7082560,htc10,The chamfered edges on front and back catches everyone's eyes and looks sexy when it reflects light. The phone is slippery though and a case would fix.,
261,7671680,htc10,The phone is completely customisable from top to bottom and will definitely catch everyone's eye. Thanks to HTC themes.,
262,7305929,htc10,No duplicate applications (Native and Google apps like calendar music player gallery) HTC has worked closely and removed many duplicate apps. You will get HTC clock and not Android clock Android calendar and not HTC calendar Google photos and not HTC gallery.,
263,1160836,htc10,The looks bit stokish when compared to its predecessors M8 and M9. You will get Android's quick toggle menu rather than HTC's conventional one. I personally prefer HTC's toggle menu over these and its missing.,
264,8551542,htc10,The phone comes with snapdragon quick charge 3.0 certified charger and it does great job by charging the phone in less than 100 minutes.,
265,2552761,htc10,Boom sound Hifi edition is awesome but not louder as M8 and M9. Having different speakers to deliver different sounds and the clarity is awesome. It beats other phones in clarity and loses when coming to loudness.,
266,9094533,htc10,HTC has improved the camera in this model and it shoots picture pretty awesome and especially in low lights it out performs others. It's does a great job in taking videos and it records audio in Hi-Res format..! The front camera too has OIS and the selfies are superb. The screen flash lights up and does the work of an external flash. Camera is awesome.,
267,8546652,htc10,The phone does gets warm while using due to its metal body and it doesn't make any impact on the performance.,
268,2477594,htc10,HTC has done a great job in software and hardware department and gives a flawless experience.,
269,4134446,htc10,Verdict : Go for it worth every penny you spend.,
270,2721983,htc10,The phone was released in India in mid June yet no phones are up for sale. Poor marketing from HTC.,
271,3720742,htc10,htc 10 is a smart mobile phone in anroidbase phone incomming in 2016 good perfomantion and runniing fast.,
272,7214949,htc10,Excellent Sound Display & Power for the phone. Camera has problems in low light.,
273,3347810,htc10,Awesome phn just go for it best phn in android world,
274,3430924,htc10,Great phone value for money don't buy online,
275,3380907,htc10,This time HTC has given tough competition to samsung i think!! Rocky 10,
276,3040112,htc10,Superb build.its the best all rounding smartphone in the univers,
277,1757374,htc10,Superb build blazing fast performance excellent camera mind blowing sound quality. And with ice view case it becomes a master piece. I recommend it for everyone,
278,5397774,htc10,It's the best phone ever,
279,4294694,htc10,his is the best,
280,3402489,htc10,I have this phone for 2 month,
281,1889783,htc10,The amazing thing is battery life is about up to 2 days with normal use and 1.5 day with heavy use,
282,2731708,htc10,Before buying this device I had to do a lot of research. I was confused between HTC 10 Galaxy S7 Edge and LG G5. Let's admit all galaxy phones suck because of software and with the worst audio. Even though display and camera are the plus points. And LG G5 was ugly I would say. So I went with HTC 10 because 1. I'm an HTC user from long time and it is the most trusted brand. And 2. It covered everything I wanted. Best audio best build best software very good camera and best display. You won't regret buying it. Go for it.,
283,4760900,htc10,The best phone I ever used.......,
284,6170429,htc10,But my phone is having problem of over heating.,
285,8302182,htc10,Other than that this phone is good compared to other phones in market,
286,3855623,htc10,From my opinion it is the best phone in the world it has also beaten Apple iPhone 6s plus,
287,8318506,htc10,Quite expensive ,

291,6617213,htc10,it is not possible to make a phone with a better battery than m8,
292,6064668,htc10,not only good is excellent and super fast maybe the fastest one ,
293,3293194,htc10,Buy Htc 10 in Topaz Gold... Best of all,
294,9812376,htc10,Super Phone Battery is way better than my HTC M8,
295,7468321,htc10,Its normal its because google doesnt optimize android very well so it need a lot of ram some kind of ridiculous and 2 gb free is enough do you want get a 3d render on it ?????,
296,7158251,htc10,Doesnt heat up in normal usage but if you plug it and using LTE at same time it heat up but not that much or use it for 4k and heat up but its normal every phone does ,
297,2282995,htc10,all of them are great I have m8 and m7 silvers and they are fantastic also got one x+ black and its still rocking so all depends on you,

336,4347377,pixel,The Google Pixel XL is a beast. It feels like having android packed inside an Iphone.,

349,1050702,pixel, brought it with so many expectations but it's doesn't meet to the described quality. This phone is overheats more than any other Android phones I used tille date. There is no reason why this phone is heated. The camera is good but it makes the phone heats more than usual. Slow charging than description and fast discharging. So unhappy with the performance,
350,6099478,pixel,I felt it's ok product. Features are good but not so great. Looks like google has copied from spoke not giving memorycard card slot and not having option to insert dual sim. No option to change the ringtones but TG has an option to use es file explorer.,
351,2397284,pixel,Heating issuevibration issue.,
352,7879524,pixel,This phone is nothing but a basic version of Android with a good camera and fat body....,
353,3446348,pixel,A basic phone which is being potryed as a flagship phone.... Not user friendly.... Not many options which are available on other android phones are not available on this.,
354,7349247,pixel,Further it has heating problem..... Yes it is heating up very fast. Have no clue as to whether I should use it or just keep it aside.,
355,6268054,pixel,More so after using 6 flagship phones till date.... I can only say that this phone cannot be called as a flagship model.... It has nothing to feel wow about....,
356,2123337,pixel,Ya... The in built Google assistant camera and the finger print scanner on the backside...... These are the features Google is bosting about......,
357,7563273,pixel,May not be in-built but Google assistant was Woking fine on other android phones.....,
358,1530602,pixel,camera.... May be better... But only by a meager margin....,
359,8901655,pixel,Finger print scanner..... Not a great deal at all... Every dumb phone now a days have it.....,
360,8259877,pixel,Finally.... It does not really have any features which other Androids are providing which make a phone user friendly....,
361,3101642,pixel,Therefore.... For the first time I am proposing to return a phone which is being called flagship but isn't one in any manner......,
362,1328361,pixel,Phone is really amazing best phone I've ever used except moto x,
363,8667323,pixel,Phone is great. Must buy for Android users. If you don't have a bigger hands buy Pixel instead of Pixel XL.,
364,8201431,pixel,One of the best Android smartphone ever made..flipkart delivered 2 day before..,
365,8796608,pixel,Amazing phone. Great battery backup. If you are looking for paisa vasool for every penny you pay.. you may be up for a disappointment. But it's the best phone available in the market. I have been using it for a week now... I'll sure endorse it.,
366,2258104,pixel,Very fast delivery by Flipkart. Exchange of old handset was smooth. The phone in itself is butter! Throw your iPhone out the window and buy this boys n gals. Amazing experience. Snapdeal is full of cheaters. I think Flipkart has really improved their overall customer focus. Almost as good as Amazon! Well done.,
367,8718149,pixel,Great phone,
368,6314613,pixel,Best phone !,
369,1081519,pixel,Product is perfect but Flipkart needs improvement on delivery on time as promised especially when it comes to expensive buys.,
370,1140982,pixel,And it's true no doubt in it. Super fastsuper snappysuperb camerafantastic battery lifeunlockable bootloaderroot easily availablefuture developer supportfastest android updates. What else do you want?!,
371,3517354,pixel,I have used both iphone and google phone and for me pixle comes out shining in all matters except in one (water proofing).,
372,4264409,pixel,The batter is just too good. With a normal use (phone calls sms whatsapp) you can easily get the phone to last around 30-32 hrs.,
373,4128077,pixel,In case of heavy use (phone calls sms whatapp youtube facebook Bluetooth etc) it lasts just around 22-24 hours.,
374,6947100,pixel,In general the phone is super fast smooth and no issues. The display is just awesome. The pics coming out of pixle is far better than the ones on iphone. you can check out some of the pics on my instagram ( @accountledger ). i have done bit of editing using google's own editor snapseed (basically snapseed launches when you edit it through google photos),
375,4274115,pixel,Over all super happy with this phone and i feel it is worth every single penny.,
376,6215179,pixel,Excellent experience.. excellent phone..as expected.,
377,7198973,pixel,This Mobile is very good product all the apps and features are good I am facing one problem in sending massage box with attachment of V card as usual we can attach phone number by attachment icons in massager box itself but in this Mobile we have to go contact app and share the to whom we to send it  so pl make this changes or facility from messenger box to get attachment of phone no in text and V card form,
378,3562178,pixel,Amazing phone with a lag free performance really awesome camera unbelievable hdr mode speed unbelievablly loud single speaker and a happy Google assistant. This phone triumphs everything on sheer software . The future of Android is here ! This is how Google wanted people to use Android,
379,6302830,pixel,Very Good Phone By Google with few drawbacks. On heavy use it gets heated Camera Good but in my opinion Samsung S7 edge is Better. OS is Fast but not Blown away. Voice Assistant is Superb.,
380,5626111,pixel,The best phone ever... Battery design and Camera standout...,
381,3677699,pixel,Very nice cameras even in low light. No VoLTE,
382,8217934,pixel,Great phone!!!,
383,4797417,pixel,Good one,
384,2493493,pixel,Awesome product....delivered on time....,
385,2051746,pixel,Love Google,
386,2910831,pixel,Really surprised by very poor sound in such a premium priced phone. It also does not support Jio sim for volte feature as on date.Better to remember that only premium pricing does not make a phone premium. I think Google will learn this lesson the hard way by the end of this financial year.,
387,4222892,pixel,The best phone to buy...guys go and buy it from Flipkart,
388,9748380,pixel,Excellent phone. Superb built quality & performance. Very much satisfied.,
389,3889928,pixel,Phone is awsome.phone is very fast.,
390,8652148,pixel,Best camera. Amazing screen. And this android in pixel phones is blazing fast. Neck to neck fight with the Iphone. Absolutely value for money. Am super happy with the product.,
391,9089367,pixel,Flipkart service has become incredible. Next day delivery. Superb.,
392,6894004,pixel,Thanks Flipkart for giving Google Pixel XL on release day ... I like this mobile just switched from iphone 6s to Pixel XL new experience in Android,
393,6741163,pixel,Got the delivery as per the committed date... thanks to Flipkart....,
394,8490633,pixel,Great delivery experience. Amazing phone.,
395,6662503,pixel,Great Delivery Service from Flipkart,
396,8415700,pixel,Best smart phone available in the market. Super Camera. Very happy with the performance. Thanks to Flipkart for faster delivery.,
397,8061417,pixel,I actually thought I received a promotional discount but it turned out to be the interest emi which got credited and shown as a discount. Surprised why it has been done in this manner. Not happy with the way Flipkart has handled this for such an expensive phone,
398,6624933,pixel,Worst service when comes to product.I am surprised.Its googles mobile.Too much heating.Mobile start heating when we shoot video.It start heating from 30 seconds and it gives,
399,7286252,pixel,Metal smell at 10 min of continuous video shoot. Due to this mobile battery is consuming very fast.,
400,6711454,pixel,I have requested for replacement to check same problem persists in all other mobiles also.Now a days might be knowing about the mobiles burning and blasting.,
401,4522811,leeco,Rear camera is excellent. Just update it to EUI 5.8.0.16s and you will see the difference. It is the best phone at 18k at present. Anyways  xiaomi has stopped launching midrange phones like Mi Note 2 in India. So be happy with LeMax 2.,
402,4839278,leeco,Le Eco Max 2 rear camera is hopeless. Front is cam is excellent but backside camera is worst of all. Though it is said 21 MP the pics are worse than a 13 MP cam. Flash light is not sufficient. Even in 1 meters distance the night time pics are coming as of VGA. Second it is not able to use wired head phones. And the cordless head phones offered by Le Eco are of high price and poor in receiving voice. I expected a lot but receive little. I had Lenovo 6000 which was far better than this worse mobile. ,
403,2080752,leeco,Hi all! I have a bit of problem with my battery. It doesnt charge fully. I leave it on charge for a night and in the morning i take it off with 99%. If I take it off and back to charge in a minute it gets 100% but if I dont it doesnt get full. Is it a bug or something? Eui 5.8. anybody has the same problem? Thanks,
404,7041031,leeco,Purchased from Snapdeal LeEco Max2inRs.17999payment made through inernet banking at least 10days before.Got yesterday eveningbut today I found not working at all means not getting on even to see logo on the screen.Trying with Snapdeal to refund till now it seems that all are sleeping.God know what is the future of Ecom companies in india as they seems careless after getting payment.It is sure this product is useless. Never buy such product from unreliable Ecom company.,
405,6997176,leeco,To get a high score keep your le max 2 in the freezer for 45 seconds and then run antutu benchmark then you will get a score around 145000,
406,2683513,leeco,The softwear is restricting the performance of the hardware for some reasons like phone temperatureavailable ram and etc . Antutu benchmarks are not always the same they are fluctuating !! Lex821 is not fake ,
407,3020141,leeco,Fingerprint is a fail here. Try calibration. If doesn't works initiate a refund. It will take 40 odd days to get ur money. Don't buy le eco again. Bad after sales services.,
408,8054147,leeco,Just one speaker. Bad fingerprint and after sales support. Not recommended by me,
409,4611022,leeco,No problem. Only the left side have a speaker. The right side is only for design. All phone have a similar speakerIs not a problem!,
410,7851371,leeco,I purchased le max 2 from lemall.com through credit card for Rs 16199/-,
411,3613705,leeco,Immediately after receiving order I upgraded it to marshmallow.,
412,9273360,leeco,At this price one must be satisfied with its features.,
413,1846290,leeco,Tatacliq.com is selling it for Rs 16999.,
414,1850413,leeco,I love its display.,
415,4752405,leeco,Battery is good.,
416,6300148,leeco,I got this phone 4 days back. Now my finger print scanner is not working. Please can anybody give a suggestion for this,
417,4349227,leeco,Fingerprint sensor will not improve even after update. After update to 5.8.0.16S  the performance  camera improved and once I got 122k. That after killing all the apps in background. But consistently it will will give 80k on antutu 6.2.1. I think that is because it has to push 2k display compared to fhd displays on other phones. Overall the phone performance became much better after update,
418,3190400,leeco,Same thing happened with me. I went to the service centre they said for repairing it will take 15to 20 days. I came back I took chance and did not go for refund with Amazon. I was waiting for update. After updating do finger print scanner calibration and register the finger print . It will start working,
419,2349500,leeco,I bought le Max 2 on 15th october2016 from Snapdeal and got the delivery on 20th October. I used it for one day and the fingerprint sensor stopped working I downloaded the system update bt nothing happened. I went to the recovery mode and reset the phone bt still nothing happened. Any suggestions..... Plzzzz....,
420,3779503,leeco,Very good phone good performance even in german language and pre installed google app store. updated newest eui 5.8.015s. Ordered directly in the leeco store phone has only Â“LEÂ“ on the backside and it is the 6GB 128 GB pro Version.,
421,5805614,leeco,Battery life same as before. However there is a catch . If you test on Antutu repeatedly over a short period of time  the antutu scores go lower and lower . from 120 to 80k again. Sustained performance is not SD820's forte. But it did touch 122k on Le Max 2 (X821). Only once.,
422,7023732,leeco,Probably the worst experience ever after buying a product online. I need to know what are my options going ahead i hate this phone camera quality (they say 21MP) and completely pissed off with your Customer Service and Service Center response.,
423,4307513,leeco,Inferior Camera Quality went to service center and all they did is update Software of the phone (as if we don't know how to update OS) and it made zero difference. I was complaining about this issue on day 1 and tried to return the phone from day 1 but your Customer Support didn't respond and your website Return / Refund web form never worked. ,
424,7787995,leeco,I have been using this phone for 4 days .I hope now am in a position to review it partially .It's working fine .I am totally satisfied by it .I bought this phone mainly for budget 2K display and I am more than satisfied.Eagerly waiting to test its sound with CDLA earphones .Finally about fingerprint sensor yes it is a bit slow at times not all .,
425,3964172,leeco,Now the specs will all blind you. Why wouldnt I go for the deal. SD 820. 4GB 21MP camera. But they all sounds good on the sheet.,
426,5986574,leeco,Coming to reality. I bought the phone on July 28 like all the crazy specs lover guys. The phone on hand seems good. The built quality is also good.,
427,1285780,leeco,However here are my cons.,
428,3391173,leeco,1: The camera bump is almost 1.5 mm. Also the camera lens unit doesnt have a scratch free lens (saphire or GG3/4). So expect lots of scratches with such a bump.,
429,1472715,leeco,2: 21MP on paper sounds good. However with every update Le max 2 messes with camera. Either low light photos are bad auto focus is bad. The photos are good but not premium range.,
430,6333761,leeco,3: Fingerprint sensor. Where do i start. This isnt just one odd case. Just check the Le Max 2 official forums and otther seller reviews. ither they are very slow or it doesnt recognize. Slowly then the fingerprint sensor dies. So you will have flagship model with no FP sensor.,
431,1968955,leeco,4: 2K screen doesnt make too much difference. However it eat up the battery for sure.,
432,6495782,leeco,5: Battery is barely average. Expect Screen on Time of 3 hours. As I said the 2K screen doesnt help it,
433,7772728,leeco,6: Service is PATHETIC. I have already replaced my phone in the replacement period. Visited the service center twice. First they took one week to flash the phone. Now its over an month and I am still waiting for the Fingerprint sensor to be repaired/replaced. So it has been over 70 days since I bought the phone and the phone has been in service center for 40 days.,
434,6083110,leeco,7: The phone is huge and heavy. I had to buy case to protect my camera and this added weight makes the phone feel like dead weight. I have a scale at home. The phone is almost 200gms.Other flagships weight 150 gms. With such big camera bump I had to buy a big case. Now my phone weighs 250 gms.,
435,4881304,leeco,Pros:,
436,3290636,leeco,1:Are you still interested? The SD820 is a beast. Also 4GB RAM is multi tasking booster.,
437,1817586,leeco,Now for fan boys who may assume that mine was one of a case just visit the Le MAX 2 official forum. It is full of issues hatred and complains. No one addresses them. Admin/Le community members are hardly seen online. So buy any phone than Le MAX 2.,
438,1743455,leeco, purchased this a while ago but this phone is awesome no negative feedback.i am happy I previously was using iphone 5s still I am happy with this phone.,
439,2748837,leeco,Super phone ,
440,5069257,leeco,Pros - good looks top notch performance gorgeous display good cameras.,
441,8976445,leeco,Cons - lack of headphone Jack bulky(180gms) slow fingerprint scanner low battery performance,
442,5486274,leeco,Very bad experience. Please do not buy dis...features are on the paper only..better put some money and buy some descent phone...poor quality product ,
443,6055278,leeco,Poor fingerprint scanner. Ordered twice and both the time the fingerprint scanner is not working ,
444,9704749,leeco,Everything is okay. But the software is not very stable. And the fingerprint sensor doesn't work out of the box. I would recommend not to buy this phone. Better go for MI5. The delivery is the worst I have experienced . And I have lodged 5-7 replacement requests but no response . ,
445,4229864,leeco,Phone is only good in specification but not in actual use. Camera and screen display is very poor battery is below average.I had Samsung note 2 it was way better than this phone.Wasted my money!,
446,1841667,leeco,Excellent as compared to it's price. It would be more excellent if it is slimmer one with upgraded processor.,
447,8235226,leeco,Item defective getting abnormal heating during charging.,
448,1133708,leeco,So.bad my second sim slot was not using ..,
449,1260950,leeco,Sim name vision but sim network not shown please....,
450,3225027,leeco,he phone is great but the finger print sensor is a pain...,
451,2198920,leeco,Phone battery backup is very poor. Battery backup is only for 4 hours after full charging. The finger sensor is also not working. Plz replace my phone,
452,1967921,leeco,BEST FOR EVER GOOD PRODUCT FROM AMAZON,
453,4337510,leeco,Best phone in its range .,
454,5378360,leeco,I purchased this a while ago but this phone is awesome no negative feedback.i am happy I previously was using iphone 5s still I am happy with this phone.,
455,7568292,leeco,This is worst product don't buy it .it's heated very much.and battery is not good.,
456,9489765,leeco,This phone is really good under price of the 20000. This phone is made by chineese company LeEco . Previously leeco launched the le 1 max which was awesome now to the next generation they launched Le max 2 which is really good no one is competitor for Le max 2 at price of 18000.,
457,2999712,leeco,Poor performance of this mobile. Customer care service is not good mr. Amir,
458,4683615,leeco,It is crap mobilebattery gets discharged within 3hours in standby mode....it's a dabba phone...,
459,4023664,leeco,Good build quality but a lot of software glitches.,
460,8309886,leeco,Never buy smarphone via Amazon if your smarphone isn't defective you are lucky if not amazon isn't gonna help you.....coming to mobile don't get fooled by its specifications the mobile I got had powering on issues battery died overnight even if it's charged for 100%....fingerprint sensor takes 2 seconds unlock when kept in idle state mobile starts to heat up and drains battery even when you are not using it....this is what you get when you buy a Chinese phone.,
461,2824253,leeco,Excellent phone,
462,9470719,leeco,The colour is not good :-(,
463,9532355,leeco,The mobile doesn't get heated up while playing games and it has a good ram manager :-),
464,8703791,leeco,While charging the mobile gets heated :-( but the phones has a quik charge option (in half and hour 50%),
465,3763900,leeco,After calibration the fingerprint scanner is more faster,
466,2772672,leeco,Camera is good ( 21 megapixels ) front camera is awesome  in lowlight the picture cums quite well,
467,5220057,leeco,Inbuilt apps are good like Levidi  Live  hangama (music player),
468,3814865,leeco,Mobile has a fast processor SD820 chip,
469,2983516,leeco,Worst Fingerprint sensor which is a major problem. Buggy UI. Other than that it's a great phone. The UI is not an open source. So the bug cleaning process is too slow.,
470,7373945,leeco,I'm just loving this phone...very good in all respects! CDLA earphones provide clarity like never before! Awesome camera RAM ROM and LeEco subscription! The only downside is the below average fingerprint scanner!,
471,2270450,leeco,It is a horrable thing i have ever seen in my life i think fingerprint is for show and the heating prob is for making omlett on mobile yes u can use for omlete making .only camera is good enough nothing else,
472,6689192,leeco,Very poor operating system. EUI is a mess ....,
473,9195336,leeco,Best mobile best software best hardware Best price,
474,7836885,leeco,It's a great phone below 20k range amazing camera quality & U.I. is also great.,
475,1387113,leeco,Great value for money. Hardware and build quality is top class but EUI is quite poor. But at this price there isn't any real competition.,
476,9671815,leeco,Awesome mobile.................before buying this mobile I traded many reviews about this mobile.............I was sacred to buy this mobile or not because of many negative reviews..............but after buying this mobile I m very happy to have this mobile in my hand......... because it's performance is very fast ........and everything is best.....ram management is best...........I play many heavy games like asphalt 8 gangster Vegas nova 3 in high graphics....and this mobile playing them very smoothly.........,
477,3488193,leeco,Only 1 thing I doesn't like that it's fingerprint scanner is slow.......but it is fine not worst........after updating software fingerprint also become fast.............,
478,4947326,leeco,If u r looking for best mobile under 20000rs then this mobile is best...........,
479,5455930,leeco,I give it 4.5 out of 5 because of fingerprint only,
480,8384080,leeco,It's amazing product,
481,1084935,leeco,The battery performance is very bad. It is consuming 85.p percent battery within 24 hrs in idle condition without using it.I want to return this phone.Please arrange to return it. How can I contact you.I am unable. to complete return process. I want to return this phone. Please help me.,
482,5660131,leeco,The most amazing phone I have ever used with a tons of pros and only some cons such as lack of expendable memory n lack of 3.5 mm jack though it will not be a problem in the long run,
483,3925247,leeco,I got a defected product.,
484,9725920,leeco,t's excellent I love this mobile features are awesome battery get charge fast but it reduces also fast 😜 everything is awesome in this mobile but problem is the fingerprint sensor and camera fingerprint sensor is very slow to unlock mobile and rear camera is also not that much good it is not we have to hold it for long to take picture and front I don't think 8 MP because my sister have HTC desire whose camera quality is very good than this mobile HTC have 8 MP and 13 MP which take very good shots. But still I like this mobile because every mobile has some different qualities and features. First I ordered this mobile and that I received defective piece but thanks to Amazon that they helped me to get out of it and gave me another mobile. For me it is best if you are looking for good features and good working games and doing any other work you should go for it otherwise you can select any other mobile. I hope this review will help you.,
485,9223844,leeco,Worst Phone.Not at all Good phone. Its not even as good as 3000 mobile. Camera is like 3MP. Not blur free. Each n every photo is normal quality. THere is no option of Zoom in. If u zoom in  its like a 0 pixels. Not worthy. Plz dont tale it. Coming to Amazon----- They are not responsible for anything once u take the delivery. they are disconnecting the calls  if u raise any complaints.,
486,2206395,leeco,The Best thing about this phone is Updates (apart from the specifications),
487,6076848,leeco,1.I purchased this phone in July..And trust me the fingerprint sensor was worstbut then magic happened a Leeco sent an update..,
488,3708110,leeco,And after that update in every phone fingerprint sensor is working like a charm !!! Yes the fingerprint sensor is awesome and working fine after the update.,
489,3799236,leeco,2 Camera :- Unbelievably awesome better than OP3,
490,1928425,leeco,3.Performance :- SD820 4 GB RAM do I need to say anything else??,
491,9272247,leeco,4.Screen :- 2K ..Which is awesome..,
492,1005745,leeco,5.CDLA :- Guyz best technology ever..and it is revolutionary..Yes if you have ur fav earbuds then I have to use a Connector Jack but still ..Best sound ..,
493,8920634,leeco,This phone is best under 30k. I purchased it in 23K still m happy and satisfied ...,
494,1725852,leeco,I love it ...CDLA headphone are amazing...,
495,9476637,leeco,This is the best phone in best price among all smart phones. It have super gaming experience and superb camera clarity of PDF technology and dual HDR and super fast processor 2.15 GHz snapdragon 820.Fast charging with C cable technology 90 minutes of full charging super battery backup of 3100 mah battery and 2k display technology.,
496,1232948,leeco,Some background: I am a tech and travel writer. As such I absolutely need a dependable phone with great overall specs and a decent camera. One that has OIS and acceptable levels of noise in low light conditions. The Le Max 2 I find meets all of these conditions. The camera is good but not stellar. However it shoots well in low light conditions and OIS works well.,
497,1472540,leeco,Look and feel:,
498,8995089,leeco,The rose gold colour is eye catching and does not look feminine in the slightest. Although. I'd preferred more colour options. The finish is fantastic. My only complaint is that it bears an uncanny resemblance to the Le Eco 2 and the camera bump is the only distinguishing factor. The all metal unibody gives it a very premium look except for the garish and protruding camera bump. While somewhat garish the camera bump is not unsightly. Ensure that you get a nice case that offers protection to the camera since the lens is likely to be prone to scratches. This is not the slimmest phone around and may feel heavier than a phone like the Mi 5. While comparatively heavier it does not feel heavy and is not unwieldy. For me. being 6'2 the weight is perfect although others may feel differently.Then again the Mi 5 has an atrocious build quality, look up the Mi 5 bend test on youtube. The Mi 5's glass back is also prone to scratches and is rather delicate. I cannot comment on the Z2 plus but I suspect that phone has a slight performance edge owing to the slightly higher clock on the SoC and lower res screen. However the screen size on the Z2 plus is small and the phone looks a tad generic. I am also not a fan of phones with a glass back.
499,2343308,leeco,Overall performance:,
500,8038541,leeco,I see a lot of complaints about benchmark scores. However as a journalist I depend on real world performance rather than benchmark scores. In this regard the phone does exceptionally well and I had no problems playing the latest games, Asphalt 8:Airborne NOVA 3 Unkilled and Dead Trigger 2. All of which work flawlessly at the highest settings with the phone temperature not crossing 40.6 degrees. At the moment I am hooked on Street Fighter 4 HD that is not available on the playstore. Surprisingly despite the flak it has received the fingerprint scanner on my unit works like a charm. I state this after using the phone for more than two weeks.

521,4226939,xz,awesome phone,
522,6144078,xz,Kya ye phone heat ? hota hai plz mujhe reply kare jyaada se jyaada log jinke paas handset hai mujhe ye set kharidna hai but ye pata karna hai ye heat hota hai ya nahi,
523,2555772,xz,It has been a week now that I have been using this gorgeous looking phone with superior build quality great hardware internals and finally a Sony phone with the camera well done. The software is well optimised decluttered and pretty straight forward as against some heavily skinned versions on other OEMs. But maybe Sony went a bit too far in cutting off some of the features which were actually helpful as seen in phones of previous generations as old as 2012 or later. Now coming to the tough part yes it is quite disappointing and frustrating to see big brands like these screw up big time on their flagships. The reference here being to a lot of software bugs (maybe hardware too) that have started to show on the device apparently across all regions. The Xperia XZ page on Sony Support Forums is riddled with various issues few of which has been reported worldwide not really something you want hear when shelling out a premium price tag device. Some of the issues most commonly users have been facing are:,
524,6815704,xz,1) The double Tap-to-Wake feature is a dud you will only hurt your fingers tapping forever.,
525,2978662,xz,2) The fingerprint scanner is not really serving the purpose. You can set it up but the chances of you unlocking the phone using PIN/Password/Pattern is more than you getting to scan your FP and be led straight to your Home screen.,
526,6490387,xz,3) There is a major issue either with video rendering or video codec handling because irrespective of where or how (YouTube Facebook Webpages or video file on phone memory) you are trying to play a video it is likely to stutter more or not play at all. A restart of the phone only solves the issue temporarily.,
527,4789018,xz,My sincere suggestion to prospective buyers just hold on for a while more and decide. It is definitely a very good phone to buy if only the issues get resolved sooner than later.,
528,2865026,xz,Omg its amazing...speechless... My dad has s7 and xz is faster than it....awesome... Camera is brilliant.. Day light shots are superb..even the best on any smartphones.. Low lights are are also good..and front facing cam is excellent... Best best.!,
529,4580440,xz,Finaly A Worthy Phone To Buy From Sony Wrongly advertized Headset/Earphones did not get MDR-NC750 instead got cheap MH750 in the box apart from that its the fastest Android device in the market currently and is silky smooth equal to that of an iPhone in terms of productivity everything feels snappier and smooth apps games photos videos you name it. For a premium price you get the fastest android in the market. Do NOT follow the reviews of this device on youtube as they are false having the device in hand and comparing it myself and I can assure you you are in one heck of a treat.,
530,6123746,xz,Dust and water proof just like I want my device to be. Quick durable and long battery life the device runs for a full one day easily with heavy usage apps games video playback but can vary according to your demand. Also the new charging technology is very innvative helping my battery to live twice as long as those in the market today.,
531,9384216,xz,The best of sony... The fastest chip... Camera is stunning (from reviews I'm yet to get it) Premium phone from the Japanese. Xperia'nce the best...,
532,8000232,xz,Looks like a very promising phone. Always been a Sony fan. Perfect for a single handed use n multimedia. Awesumn technology embedded in ot like qnovo chargin. So the phone battery can last longer. With this phone they have treated all the negative points which last year xperias had. No heating issues n a better camera. Dxo hasnt rated xperia xz. Just waiting to see its scores n order it. Waitin fr it to hit markets!,
533,8647100,xz,This is best smartphone from Sony I'm always big fan of Sony. Sound and camera quality is better than any other phone in this category. Performance is very good.,
534,5879142,xz,I am big Sony fan... have used nearly all sony flagship devicebut this one is a beast of all. I know its bit costly but you get quality if you can pay for apple why not for sony.,
535,1705756,xz,> Device UI is super smooth and fast,
536,7413752,xz,>Battery life last for a day with heavy usage. I connect smart band all the time. Play heavy graphics game like asphalt Mortal Comat Battlefeild,
537,6629528,xz,no lags,
538,6091548,xz,>Screen display is super crisp and resolution is awesome,
539,6108269,xz,>Has dual speaker sound is good,
540,2401943,xz,>Camera is awesome still trying to get the best out of it,
541,3223671,xz,>the look of the device is premiumafterall it is sony,
542,3940228,xz,Now coming to the earset issue yes it comes with MH 750 not high resolution one I have already complaint sony for it still waiting for their feedback.I think we should raise a complain to sony so that we can get some compensation for the mistake. Amazon is just a seller so i dont think there is any mistake from there side,
543,4917343,xz,First off: Nope. You don't get NC750. The bundled ones are cheap ones with no noise cancellation and bad mic.,
544,8593335,xz,Tried to pre order it but couldn't get the band. Amazon was really bad at service and never called back (Contacted them more than thrice).,
545,2158202,xz,The device itself is awesome. Really fast. Camera is responsive and the focus speed is stupendous. Using for couple of days and have charge it once. I got device with 20%. An amazing device overall. Touch latency is low which is nice,
546,8583816,xz,Awesome phone. Best of Android in terms of software. No glitches and hangs like some other brands in this price range.The 5 axis camera stabilisation technique is remarkable. It even beats the optical stabilisation phones with ease. But very few people know these which make Samsung on the top in Android. Moreover comparing reliability also Sony phones last longer without anu problem. Using my z1 right from its launch (2013) till now no lags. thanks to their neat UI. If android buy it else buy an apple. Don't waste your money elsewhere at price range.,
547,6678107,xz,No phone is perfect and neither is this one. It's all about what you're happy to ignore and what matters the most to you in a smartphone. I personally bought it from an authorised sony store on 8th oct and can safely say i was the first one to buy it in india. Its a pretty damn good product but if you compare it to others you'll definitely find things against it like its hardware. Im sure you must have read other reviews by now and this is what i have to say for them- buy ram separately if you want 4 or 6 GB buy a 4K TV if you like viewing pleasure. This phone has enough ram to perform like a champ (go check it out yourself or watch videos). Sony never had ram management issues ever unlike brands which offer 4/6 GB which they did. Screen wise the 1080p display is gorgeous and works well with the product. Smooth performance and great battery justify the use of 1080 in my opinion. Rest the phone is top notch and i can bet my life you won't be disappointed in the purchase. So i would suggest- spend 50k on this not for the ram or 1080p display but for the overall product which is a great buy!,
548,2503796,xz,Camera is really awesome..... As followed by YouTube video reviews the phone is cheap and worth in this range....one morething 64 gb internal is really comfortable..,
549,8947811,xz,The headphones we r getting is different from what they advertise.,
550,6694352,xz,Best and beast from sony... I love it aa lot,
551,8307833,xz,Already impressed with the video reviews on YouTube. It beat's all of the competition. Pre ordered it can't wait to have this phone. Long live Sony!!! Been using this phone for more that 15 days now and got to say really the phone is awesome. No lag at all and handles everything I throw at it. The display is just gorgeous and I have no complaints of it being a 1080p display. Really impressed with the camera one of the best in class. Coming to disappointments software feels like not finished some bugs are there but I hope they will fix it the Nougat update arriving soon. Not got the promised headphones which turned out to be a mistake from Amazon side.,
552,8727050,xz,I have been a Sony Lover for last 5 years was nearly tempted to buy the Iphone 7. Saw both the phones today and let me tell all the Sony looks awesome with a great camera and its still photography while moving is terrific. Am buying the Sony.,
553,7243856,xz,If it's Sony then you don't have to worry at all. I have used all Sony Xperia ™ phones and not even one has disappointed me. Sony Xperia XZ Dual is another marvel from Sony. Camera is as good as any standalone cameras in the market. Built quality is amazing. Display is natural unlike some other brands which believe in bright over contrast display. You will love every bit of it. Go for it.,
554,8992546,xz,Xperia xz rocks,
555,8506473,xz,Video stabilisation is the best with natural color reproduction ... Samples from youtube,
556,4405690,xz,A true rocker in smartphone have arrived!!!😍😍😍,
557,1875270,xz,"Dont buy this product by just seeing that this product includes ""High-Resolution Audio Headset MDR-NC750"" in box. This is fake information posted by Amazon. Buy this product coz of Sony you will get the normal earphones with this phone MH-750.",
558,8956517,xz,Actually to be honest this is the best mobile from Sony. don't worry about the price I accept it's quite high but when you need a tag like Sony you should pay for and it's worth paying. The key feature is its 5-axis image stabilisation which beats i-phone 7 image stabilisation and you can see samples on YouTube. Then the triple image sensing technology allows you to capture the wow of now and ever without blur. Seriously Sony fans will go crazy and other mobile users will be for sure. Don't buy some cheap mobiles having more configuration.,
559,5077249,xz,I bought mobile on 09.10.2016 from Sony Center in Hyderabad & it's very impressive and stunning. Especially Camera Music Gaming and Display all are ultimately defined.,
560,9014633,xz,If you are bored with Samsung and apple. Here is the best alternative with all flagship features.. even better than apple's offering. Best in class and also economic than its rivals. 1. Great design 2. Superb camera both front and back 3. Clean UI 4. Android N available October end 5. Water proof The cost of an iPhone or Google pixel is 650$ but in india it is selling at 770 $. The only phone which has same pricing in both US and India is Sony xperia Xz for 700$ . 7. High resolution audio 8. Best stereo speakers. 9. Hybrid sim tray 1. Not shipping already with android N. Xperia XZ lets you capture without blur in 23MP. It has triple sensing camera a combination of focus sensing by image sensor distance sensing by laser AF sensor color sensing by RGBC-IR sensor. It sports “world’s first 5-Axis Image stabilisation technology in a Smartphone” for shake free shooting. 13MP front camera is made to shoot in wide angle & low-light thanks to Exmor RS sensor. ALKALEIDO TM metal built ads to the strength and finishing it’s so durable due to design features like Gorilla Glass 4 and IP68 Water resistant design. The ultimate Snapdragon 820 (64bit) for super-fast processing and 64GB internal memory for enhanced storage option while you go free hand recording in 4K video mode or downloading Hi-Res Audio content,

573,9257969,xz,Good mobile,
574,5164439,xz,It's really a value for money. It's elegant look beats some top graded phones like Samsung and i phone. Moreover latest android system helps the devise run like a butter. Camera of this phone beats all other devices in this price range. If at all you want to invest your money in mobile yes this is the phone you are looking for. Buy this phone else don't but Mobile.,
575,1802889,xz,Nice phone though i haven't still got my hands on it still this phone is awesome by all aspects. The only downside is ram but 3 GB is still good for a high end smartphone. Finally sony has made a good phone after a long time.,
576,1995840,xz,"Sony's latest flagship the Xperia Z6 comes with refined design improved camera and a due update in specs. Wait back up a little there - it's actually called the Xperia XZ this time around but yeah the rest of that is true.When Sony announced the new X-series some suggested that the Xperia X Performance was meant to take on the likes ofthe Galaxy S7's and HTC 10's but we knew that couldn't be the case. Okay 'suspected' might be more accurate there. Obviously now we all know that the Xperia XZ is Sony's top-dog for this season and the Z in its name quickly reveals its ancestry.Indeed the XZ has a lot in common with the Z5. The display for one is the same size and resolution as the last generation - not necessarily a bad thing but the XZ also comeswith 3GB of RAM - modern-day flagships will crack a condescending smile seeing that in the spec sheet.No one will laugh at the rest of it though - top-of-the-line Snapdragon 820 chipset 23MP camera with a trio of focusing technologies and 4K video recording (one could think the Z is required for that had it not been for the M5)high-res 13MP front camera Type-C connectivity fingerprint reader IP68 rating stereo speakers - name one thing missing.Sony Xperia XZ key features5.2"" 1080 x 1920px LCD display with 424ppi X-Reality for Mobile Triluminos technology; Gorilla GlassAndroid OS v6.0 Marshmallow withXperia launcherQualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset: quad-core Kryo CPU (2x2.15GHz +2x1.6GHz); Adreno 530 GPU; 3GB RAM23MP Sony IMX300 camera 24mm-equiv. f/2.0 lens predictive hybrid laser/phase detection/contrast AF IR sensor for white balance selection SteadyShot LEDflash dedicated hardware shutter key; 4K video recording13 MP front-facing camera with 1080p@30fps video32GB/64GB of built-in storage and a microSD card slotSingle and dual-SIM models (DualSIM has a hybrid slot shared with the microSD card)LTE Cat.9 (450/50 Mbps); Dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; GPS/GLONASS/Beidou Bluetooth v4.2Active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic; 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio2900mAh non-removable battery QuickCharge 3.0 support Qnovo adaptive charging Battery Care smart chargingIP68 rating for dust- and water-proofingFingerprint sensor (market dependent) stereo speakers USB Type-C port 3.5mm headphone jackMain shortcomings3GB of RAM when the competition has almost entirely switched to 4GB or 6GBFullHD screen resolution not flagship-gradeFingerprint recognition not available in the USWe're yet to see tangible proof that the RAM race leads to actual usability benefits but if people were to reason that way the industry would sit still. It would have been great though if Sony could have gone with 4GB just to keep up with the times and avoid having reviewers write this paragraph and make themlook bad. The extra 1GB can't cost that much right?The second count Sony might end up countering with a sequel to the UltraHD XperiaZ5 Premium - 1080p for the mainstream flagship 2160p for that supposed Premium and no 1440p at all. Makes sense.",
577,2746271,xz,The only reason you will buy this phone is if you are a Sony fan boy. When it comes to audio camera and overall performance there are better phones available for the same price point. The OnePlus 3 is a cheaper option which feels more fluid but has a simpler camera. If you are looking to pick up a flagship you can consider the iPhone 7 Google Pixel and even the Samsung Galaxy S7.,

592,6355357,xz,Camera quality is extraordinary 5 axis stabilization is out of this world...no phone stands close to it. Everything else is premium quality. I would say it's an iPhone running android os...,
593,1564500,xz,Got this device and completely in love with it. Awesome user experience and smooth UI. Typing isn't a hassle as many Internet reviews would have stated. All it takes is some getting used to. Screen quality is excellent so is the build. Feels really good in hands a little slippery incase you have butter fingers. Speakers aren't too loud but stereo quality is excellent. Headphones work fine although I did get issues connecting my bose wired ones but all others and wireless work great especially with Sony Clear audio feature. device performance is gradually improving and in just 4 days I am already enjoying the change. camera modes are really good and there is a lot to explore. Love the natural colors on the screen and overall usage.,
594,7997220,xz,It is awesome,
595,7644720,xz,Mid night masala  I pre ordered on oct 1 xz  I received smart band at 8:30 pm great again corrier boy came at 11:15 and asked smart band cost of money yes. actually it's free for pre order. I called to customer care they also asking to pay for watch.,
596,4655337,xz,As the offer says free smartband it doesnt apply any promo code and total amount asks for full around rs59k. I find the promotion misleading by cloudtail and sony.,
597,2721363,xz,Performance wise its ok. but not worth 50k. Better phones with better specs available for much less price. Why not buy Z2 or Z3 instead of this. They are quite decent phones.,
598,1533168,xz,The best of Sony,
599,8904487,xz,Overpriced like helll!!!are you kidding 1080p,
600,9539287,xz,With other brands superior to this Sony lags the market niche. Here we have number of mobile companies concentrating on customer satisfaction Sony is satisfying their own. By giving high budget phones in the market they will not capture the Smartphone business at all. Their previous basic phones with superb quality music did their goal in the hands of millions of people but now with these high budget phones they are far behind the peak for success.,

702,8315618,oneplus3,It came Pre-applied with the Oneplus screen protector without any air bubbles. Kudos to Oneplus. This probably is the biggest and slimmest Oneplus devices yet.,
703,6233508,oneplus3,The Design of the phone is though not quite unique many people might still find it appealing.,
704,2767086,oneplus3,The USB Port 3.5mm Aux Mic and Speaker are placed towards the bottom of the Phone.,
705,5717494,oneplus3,Power button on the right hand side Volume buttons and Notification slider on the left hand side.,
706,9775169,oneplus3,The device is very Slim and looks very pleasing with the Metal built construction. Curvy edges on all corners of the phone and the glass on the screen is curvy towards the edges too which looks similar to the glass type offered on the Samsung S7.,
707,5460654,oneplus3,Firstly i ordered the phone from a seller Amiable Electronics Private Limited and first thing that they shipped the phone after 4 days of placing the order. I was soo frustrated by this and i ordered the phone from another seller and i got it today and I've still not got that phone whichAmiable Electronics sent.,
708,1371564,oneplus3,Comming to the phone itself is just amazing i really liked the build quality and the performance. GOD damn it feels good in the hand. OnePlus 3👌guys go for it its an awesome phone.,
709,6379245,oneplus3,Excellent phone very good features and camera quality. Worth money,
710,5350520,oneplus3,Best smartphone to buy at this price point.,
711,4069427,oneplus3,My request for - Oneplus community is please dont change your UI (Like stock android experience) to something worst like touchwiz sense etc.,
712,9660883,oneplus3,PROS:,
713,5882972,oneplus3,1) Ofcourse the 6 GB RAM highlights the device,
714,4654753,oneplus3,2) CAMERA quality is just mind boggling.,
715,2234803,oneplus3,3) Design is good too. Metal finishes are great.,
716,6980756,oneplus3,4) Sound Quality is Good.,
717,6033312,oneplus3,5) Good Antutu Benchmark Scores.,
718,6493334,oneplus3,6) MUST SAY IT HAS THE FASTEST FINGERPRINT SENSOR UP TO DATE.,
719,1147357,oneplus3,CONS:,
720,1043229,oneplus3,1) If you look your phone as a storage device like PC or Laptop then you may feel disappointed since it doesnt have External storage capability.,
721,3377174,oneplus3,2) Battery Capcity is less. Keeping the 6GB RAM in mind.,
722,8769082,oneplus3,I am using the phone from last 10 days and believe me it simply is a phone you want. Really gr8 UI almost similar to stock Android ..no heating issues...played NFS & Asphalt 8 for long.. cool cam with this price range ... I really loved it.,
723,1193714,oneplus3,Yes finally I got my dream phone.....this is too much fast than other Mobiles.,
724,1844766,oneplus3,Hands down this is probably the best Android phone at this price point. It does everything that you want out of modern day smartphone and then some. I am absolutely in love with the dash charging feature. It has fundamentally changed the way I look at charging in general. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor and it's mind boggling 6gb RAM is sure to woo you over. If this phone is on your shortlist for a while (2 months for people like me) be rest assured the phone will be worth every penny.,
725,3033884,oneplus3,Using OP3 since 3 weeks worth the price. Performance is smooth and good battery backup. Loved the dash charging feature.,
726,3638332,oneplus3,Go for this device without looking further.,
727,7999095,oneplus3,It is very speedy phone use is very smooth. The look is stunning and best part is back which is none slippery. I like it to hold in my hand. Only thing I worry is non availability of screen guard similar to what comes with OP3.,

737,2679821,oneplus3,The phone is good but only problem is its battery which despite many promises lasts only one day. Also background data usage eats up the data package. Rest all is fine.,
738,8595568,oneplus3,A beast ... A must buy  one I'm concerned with is it gets heated up while Dash Charging,
739,5209152,oneplus3,Definitely a flag so killer of this year smooth to handle n fluid to usewith 12 months of accidental damage benefit I got my screen replaced for just 1000inr. Only minus is screen is very delicate and mobile is slippery need to buy pouches and tampered glass.,
740,6918635,oneplus3,Worthy upgrade... worth every penny...,
741,4122199,oneplus3,1) Battery is sufficient,
742,2473729,oneplus3,2) Performance awesome,

780,8958056,oneplus3,There are some software issues that continue to bother me. The phone itself however is amazing. I love it. And i couldn't believe that even without prime the product was delivered to me within a and a half day. Amazon delivery rocks.,
781,3614282,oneplus3,This is a great phone and even I would say it's better than Samsung s7. And if you would like me to suggest then I would love to suggest that if the battery capacity can be increased some more than it will be beyond imagination.

801,2684845,motoz,Stunning phone....,
802,2845717,motoz,I am still in awe with the phone. It's the slimmest sexy thing I hv ever come across.,
803,5846400,motoz,Best phone I have owned till date. Very fast lightweight and sleek. Running Jio VOLTE calls out of the box. Flipkart delivered one day before scheduled delivery date. My only grudge is that the JBL Soundboost Mod was out of stock in five minutes and the Incipio Power Pack is not even open for pre-order.,
804,1862071,motoz,Amazing phone great look and awesome features thinnest and feel ultra light in hand,
805,3263591,motoz,Speechless,
806,2523149,motoz,Nice phone but moto z has a hybrid slot for sim 2 and memory card. But moto z play can run 2 sim along with memory card,
807,2230673,motoz,All in One....ohhhh....I love motooooo:),
808,1452106,motoz,Bad battery backup and bad camera in low light and also in zoom bad camera,
809,6729510,motoz,The GOOD: No phone offers you the swap-able options as this does. The mods which snap on hassle through the magnetic connectors at the back of the phone are not only cool but they do work quite well especially the JBL Speakers which are awesome. A quad-core 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with integrated Adreno 530 graphics 4GB of RAM and a generous 64GB of storage is GOOD enough. 13MP camera comes with most interesting spec of optical image stabilisation. Front camera is 5-megapi...,
810,6604783,motoz,Battery back up not upto the mark.. 40000rs mobile nd just 2600 mah.. not enough.. running out of battery ..battery draining very soon.. portable charge mod also not available.. ,
811,7356465,motoz,Phone is really awsm bt their is some heating issue..,
812,4194433,motoz,It is amazing! WORTH IT!,
813,8278333,motoz,Excellent device and excellent one day delivery by Flipkart. The device is very good looking and Full Metal body is excellent also the device doesn't heat up that much and the performance has been amazingly fast. No complaints till now,
814,3553726,motoz,Awesome phone and prompt delivery. I have not experienced any issues with battery. But while using camera app phone is getting heated slightly. Headset is good. Except getting using camera ,
815,3100897,motoz,This is the best phone that I own till date. The mods are fab and the phone is sleek and super fast. The battery is also not bad. Loving this phone. :),
816,6997263,motoz,Build Quality is good. The phone heats a lot a though. Also i dint like the UI or graphics of all the icons etc. ITs too large. Specially after seeing the UI of Google Pixel. One major issue not sure how may of them are facing this. Second slim slot is not working. Not sure if its only in my piece or its a generic issue for moto z. I have placed an order for replacement in Flipkart. Their support is good so far... Will post the update once i get the replaced set.,
817,9750866,motoz,After using Nexus series phones for almost 6 years! I had bought this Moto Z though I am not a great fan of neither Motorola nor Lenovo. Once I started using the phone with it Moto mods it is quite amazing. The response is so quick and the Moto mods work seamless with the phone. I bought camera mod and it is really fantastic wondering if I really wanna carry back-breaking SLR camera while trekking. ,
818,8381559,motoz,An absolutely stunning phone amazing performance and buying experience was a breeze with flipkart.highly recommend the phone.the slimmest flagship device.,
819,7195413,motoz,Hi friends the Retailer SuperComNet has delivered the Moto z product very fast in neat & clean packaging.the mobile is working very well with Moto Mods but one style Mod that comes with mobile is unable to save the cameras lens.The item was completely sealedNew & legitimate. Thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery & assured products.This type of goodwill & hard work has increased my faith at Flipkart. A very Happy Diwali to Flipkart & it's team.Really guy's keep it up.,
820,7898593,motoz,Wowwww what a phone really slimmest premium category phone previously I was using Moto x force but its little bulky this is the best design phone very slim and light weight good battery backup. Good camera great performance ,
821,4444475,motoz,Very good phone... Good performance... OS experience... Camera... The modulaf design everything is just awesome... Truly a revolutionary Moto,
822,4391354,motoz,This is an absolutely fantastic mobile with a jaw dropping design. Loved it!,
823,3558008,motoz,Received a defective product - Moto Z. Since then having issues in getting it replaced. Pathetically slow Returns and Replacement process.,
824,5227352,motoz,This product has weak point if we use external micro SD cad then the phone is single SIM supported system. We can either use 2nd SIM or micro SD card up to 2 TB. This is also a bad future of this phone. The data obtaining from internal memory card from phone is not so easy. It does not easily connect with Computer and does not allow to obtain video file downloaded to Internal Memory card of Phone. This is also a weak point. Every downloaded file directly goes to internal memory card of this...,
825,2567560,motoz,Just a Basic phone. It's over priced. Heating problem still persists after exchange. Not recommended at all,
826,9671861,motoz,Camera quality very poor. Phone heat everything. Sim 1 auto disabled.,
827,1518965,motoz,It's a good except camera resolution.i am awaiting for moto z force with 21 MP camera,
828,1656811,motoz,Just wasted my money i called many times tp change my phone bit no reply from flipkart,
829,9871847,motoz,Typical Chinese company( Use and throw material But it’s not worth investing on this) I had High Regards for the Motorola Brand before Things have changed in the last few months after running around the Motorola service centers and speaking to the Customer service desk... You will find Morons who will run around the bush and give lame answers not coming to the actual problem. You wouldn’t find any ways to get into a manager and the top management who again are incompetent and would never reply back to you. they would send a automated mails as reply and not summarizing the actual issues and fixing the problems............ which would leave you with the dumb hand set and you would also not be able to log a complaint in the consumer court. i had bought a Moto flagship phone X style for 26k in discount of 3K also having paid another 6-8K for screen replacement and now they want me to pay another 8-9K for that again which would make me spend total about 45K. I would have bought an apple phone Instead. having all this said the it would be a huge mistake if I recommend anyone to buy this Product Think wise before you face the same problem.,
830,1141854,motoz,If you could please add a little more money to buy oneplus3. That is what I have been regret after buying this phone. Looks are good but that's all. The processor is under performing and when compared to one plus3 it has one of the best in market snapdragon's 820 which is used in high end phone's. Moto z play's performance is below average and hangs a lot when I use it had to put cyanogen mod to improve it screwing my warranty. I'm not saying it's the worst but also not saying that it's the best in this price range.,
831,5507352,motoz,Decent phone with a great battery life and near stock UI. The phone is well buil. Display is crisp and clean. The package includes an earphone  extra USB C Cable and a power brick which is a turbo charger and a Moto Mod Snap op cover which is off wood finish. Moto mods are priced on the higher side. Sound quality is good. On regular usage the phone lasts a day. Pricing is on the higher side but that gives a really good build quality phone compared to other brands. It's SD625 which is a good mid range processor. Call quality is good as well Camera is decent and nothing to rave about. At this price the direct competition is One Plus 3.,
832,4118509,motoz,Kindly provide me a contact no so that i may lodge my complaint regarding defective mobile handset MOTO Z PLAY which i purchased on 30th october and the problem occured last night..There is no network available in both the sims as it is showing airplane mode although airplane mode has been disabled..,
833,1885585,motoz,Product delivered on time with good packing. But my mobile speaker is not working within 5 days. and identified as a hardware issue and requested for replacement.,
834,3762268,motoz,Very cheap fitting style mod looks like a cheap chinese plastic toy fitting part- certainly not depicting the quality of a top class brand.Moto Z Play with Style Mod (White 32GB),
835,7664926,motoz,Major Problem in the phone is its Heat a lot while the phone is charging. Sometime it feels that it may Burst while charging. Camera quality is very good. easy to use. and looks wise it is good.,
836,4027088,motoz,Worst product from moto and worst service from Amazon. My moto z play is overheating after approaching customer service they asked me to run smart check software which says phone is OK now they say to go to nearest moto service centre for further check further they say phone will be only replaced if service centre cannot repair the product. New product and repair but not replace never expected such worst service from Amazon.,
837,2320716,motoz,Overall nice performance heating issue while charging may be due to turbo charging. Front camera is good but rear camera would have been better due to lack of optical image stabalization. Bulky phone may be due to heavy battery but with premium looks.,
838,7681072,motoz,Everything is good. Battery backup very good. but fingerprint sensor not working properly,
839,3097699,motoz,It's getting heat and battery life is not good and customer Care support is not available,
840,1222885,motoz,the phone is getting overheated while charging we can literally iron our clothes without using electric iron. I am at puzzle how to return the product as there is no option available. amazon may come to our rescue.,
841,8447194,motoz,Shipment is too late. Never got parcel this late. Phone is good till now . But back side of camera get scratches very easily. After a week my back camera got so many scratches. Build quality is questionable .,
842,2895435,motoz,It's not value for money. I have been using it since one week and it starts hanging now. I am not satisfied with the product. It looks good ultimate battery life but it hangs a lot.when I use hike and tap double to nudge then it does not respond to nudge even after I turned on the nudge on double tap in the hike setting.So I don't think its value for money.,
843,1384235,motoz,"Once we use any third party camera application the device is struck on that screen. If we force close or minimize that app and try using Native Camera App it does not work at all ""Camera error: Please restart camera"" pop up appears and it does not work normal till we restart the device.",
844,1401260,motoz,The camera lens of this phone and as well as Moto G4 plus is made of plastic and scratches very easily withing a few days I had a very bad experience and suffered a loss when i found out that the camera lens will last long it would be badly scratched within a short period of time. It even scratches if you clean it with a dry cloth. Lenovo is a chinese company and they are cutting costs where ever they can. they are just making devices that just looking good and that's just people want these days. People are caring just about specs and give a lot of importance to the looks of the phone. eventually 1/3 of the phones with and up with broken screens at some point of time and now the chances have doubled since they put the glasses on the back of the phones too. I had to sell my g4 plus at a loss of Rs3500 and this phone i sold for Rs20000 five thousand loss in ten days on this phone. Samsung also put the plastic lens on the galaxy s2 that i purchased in june 2011 and it scratched badly in two years time that i used but samsung learned from their mistake and now even their cheaper phones come with scratch resistant glass. I would highly recommend oneplus 3 three over this phone. this is the third time i am writing this review but somehow amazon keeps deleting my review because some people are reporting abuse and making my review to be deleted by amazon.,
845,5081129,motoz,the moto z play is just monster in terms of performance the camera quality is good the fingerprint scanner is quick 0.9sec to be accurate also the sound quality is crispy and clear front camera in average nothing to brag about the display quality is good and no issues until today its been nearly a month . the battery last me a day although i am a heavy internet user like (youtubing gaming music for about 4hours a day) and other work related things like checking and sending mails .,
846,5558637,motoz,Typical Chinese company( Use and throw material But it’s not worth investing on this) I had High Regards for the Motorola Brand before Things have changed in the last few months after running around the Motorola service centers and speaking to the Customer service desk... You will find Morons who will run around the bush and give lame answers not coming to the actual problem. You wouldn’t find any ways to get into a manager and the top management who again are incompetent and would never reply back to you. they would send a automated mails as reply and not summarizing the actual issues and fixing the problems............ which would leave you with the dumb hand set and you would also not be able to log a complaint in the consumer court. i had bought a Moto flagship phone X style for 26k in discount of 3K also having paid another 6-8K for screen replacement and now they want me to pay another 8-9K for that again which would make me spend total about 45K. I would have bought an apple phone Instead. having all this said the it would be a huge mistake if I recommend anyone to buy this Product Think wise before you face the same problem.,
847,9528205,motoz,Best phone in battery life .. I was using Samsung Galaxy note edge. better than Samsung phone. Nice performance . No heating . 0%heating in charging or long tak or gaming. Best phone ever . 3gb ram is enough for this phone. No slow down problem . Having good performance. love it,
848,4634825,motoz,This handset is amazing and the style mod which is free with the phone protects the back panel provides a good grip and of course gives a dashing look to the phone. 3GB RAM works good but there is a flaw that it should have come with the space of 64GB....I'm happy anyway :),
849,8839343,motoz,If you could please add a little more money to buy oneplus3. That is what I have been regret after buying this phone. Looks are good but that's all.

850,2952938,motoz,The phone works like charm... I have been using it for 15 days now.... Its build quality is superb though the fibre back is not gorilla protected so the scrathes started to show after few days but you can cover them by applying a skin or cover. The battery backup on this device is extraordinary. This kind of battery backup is not seen in phones of this price bracket. It charges from 0 to 100 in 120 mins which is not great but bearable. The processor is powerful enough to handle any game I play on it without lag be it Asphalt or Modern Combat. Though the ram is only 3gb but its ram management is good and it doesn't flush out applications out of it. The software on this phone is so smooth and UI is clean along with its superb tough response. It recognize even the slightest touches. Motorola has announced the nougat update for this device and I am eagerly waiting for that...If want excellent battery life with fairly powerful phone and awesome android experience then this is it...Buy it and you will not regret.,
851,1391537,motoz,Go for gr8 battery life and gaming.....camera in low light is not good... otherwise superb....for moderate usge u vill get around 2 days...for heavy usage surely it will last for 1 day...no doubt ...i am getting SO time 9 -10 hours....,
852,8154422,motoz,Great phone. Great battery back up. Great performance. Only thing I didn't liked about this phone is back of the phone is of glass. However there's a default moto style back provided in package which fits great on back hence overcome the glass back shortcoming and protects the glass back.,
853,9294586,motoz,Wonderful mobile. Battery withstands for a whole day even 4g data running on. Camera quality of the cameras are better than G4 plus.',
854,1936397,motoz,Decent phone with a great battery life and near stock UI. The phone is well buil. Display is crisp and clean.

855,3578193,motoz,Hey Guys I bought this device for 24999/- INR on amazon and my first impression of the device was astonishing. I am really thrilled and impressed by the design and looks of the device. Back panel of the device is all glossy and is made up of glass. The device in hand looks premium and stylish. One problem i encountered is that its a bit slippery without mod from the back. And style mod which we get free in the box makes the device bit heavier. Overall really good performance exceptional battery life and management and fairly good front and back camera but in low light performance is not as good you expect.,
856,6426071,motoz,Kindly provide me a contact no so that i may lodge my complaint regarding defective mobile handset MOTO Z PLAY which i purchased on 30th october and the problem occured last night..There is no network available in both the sims as it is showing airplane mode although airplane mode has been disabled..,
857,5977403,motoz,AMAZING PHONE... LOOKS VERY PREMIUM... PERFORMANCE IS EXCELLENT... EXCEPT THE AUTO MODE IN CAMERA IS SLIGHTLY LAGGING (TAKES A WHILE FOR AUTO FOCUS) BUT COMPENSATED WELL WITH THE FRONT CAM FLASH... OVERALL EXCELLENT PRODUCT,
858,1492360,motoz,Awesome device. I won't discuss much about the pros and cons as there are many of them around here. But I want to clarify that this device has gorilla glass 3 as said by the motorola india support. And about the phone it is very smooth and never lagged even on heavy tasks like gaming and all. The battery is great it can last upto 2 days of moderate usage and sot of 10 hours. People who want the best battery life should go with this device without any hesitation. Thank you.,
859,8839576,motoz,"Great phone heavy continuous use gives me 7 hours of battery. Moderate use makes the phone runs for 24 hours and light usage 45hours. Initially it may feel of you use the finger print sensor to lock and unlock but once you start using it you can't live without it. Camera is better than mi5 and nexus 5with HDR this phone has shaky pics with HDR also make sure to keep the hand still while taking photos . The 5.5 inch Screen looks bigger initially but in a few days you'll see 5 inch as small display. The front loud speaker is loud and clear. Games play nicely. Jio 4g has super voice quality internet works also good. This phone had better wireless and network reception. Use ""Clorox s line rubber back cover"" and the phone looks even better and slimmer. Overall very happy with the phone. Yes go for it.",
860,4920561,motoz,Build quality - I am an old moto customer and build quality of moto is always good I did had some problem with moto e but moto z play is awesome with build quality keys at right are nicely designed and the body look heavy and smart too.,
861,7829975,motoz,With great expectations and with lot of excitement I have purchased this Moto Z play. though it is just 3 thousand rupees lesser than One Plus and though with average specs. Still I thought this is the futuristic mobile. But I have an annoying experience with the S/W of the device.,
862,2374853,motoz,With great expectations and with lot of excitement I have purchased this Moto Z play. though it is just 3 thousand rupees lesser than One Plus and though with average specs. Still I thought this is the futuristic mobile. But I have an annoying experience with the S/W of the device.,
863,1442776,motoz,Worst part is this is my replacement device same issue occurred on the first purchased device that was replaced by a new one even that has the same issue. I wonder what kind of S/w testing did they do where did they did not check such a basic issue.,
864,9024813,motoz,Pros : awesome display  build quality  battery life  optimized RAM management  smooth to operate,
865,6796014,motoz,Cons : front facing cam struggle alot in low light.,
866,9865406,motoz,Received Phone after 2 days of ordering as usual amazon - delivery good on first day of receiving phone I noticed that I can not setup fingerprint unlock fingerprint unlock set up option was not available in security menu under Settings. I tried all possible ways but no luck. After two days Amazon technician came and he confirmed and now waiting for new device... praying god for non-defect mobile...,
867,2676394,motoz,"I purchased this phone on Oct 30 and it was delivered on Nov 2 very fast shipping great service from Amazonpackaging is OK now about the phone it looks stunning in real than in pictures been using this device for three days as my daily driver no performance lags at all and I have to mention specifically about the battery it just goes on and on like I'm getting two days on full charge easily with 10 hours of on screen time camera quality is good but not par with other devices of this range nevertheless it's a great camera  the finger print scanner is blazing fast and it doubles as a locker too  my only complaint with this device is size it is huge because of the bezels it feels like 6"" phone",
868,7030357,motoz,First of all thanks to Amazon for delivering the product before the expected date of delivery. Now about the phone itself. I had thought a lot about the phone to buy and had considered multiple options. Finally considering the budget I rounded down to the Moto Z play and the One Plus 3. Now deciding between these two was quite tough. But what tipped my decision in favour of the Moto Z was the expandable storage and the sound output through the headphone jack. I listen to a lot of music on my phone and can't compromise on the sound quality. Though the OP3 could get really loud the sound output or rather the quality was a bit flat/ treble heavy for my liking. I referred to the reviews by Geekyranjit on YouTube and wasn't disappointed with the sound quality. It is a pleasure hearing music on this Moto Z Play. The bundled earphones are quite cheap so you may want to invest in better quality headphones. Also I was concerned about the size as I have only used sub 5inch phones before this. But I found the Moto Z play quite easy to manage. The screen quality is very good too. The camera could do with some improvements though as the quality is strictly OK.,
869,4079294,motoz,Received Phone after almost one week of ordering on first day of receiving phone I noticed that I can not setup fingerprint unlock fingerprint unlock optional was not available in security. I tried to reboot device/start device in safe mode nothing worked.,
870,1903272,motoz,Battery on this guy is a monster even with heavy usage it lasts more than a day...,
871,4872865,motoz,Only 1 con the interface. Personally I don't like Moto interface so have yo install third party launchers to change the interface.,
872,7842356,motoz,The phone is nice but misses few basic features such as restart etc. does not have lot of features like Samsung bike mode etc,
873,1168263,motoz,the phone is getting overheated while charging we can literally iron our clothes without using electric iron. I am at puzzle how to return the product as there is no option available. amazon may come to our rescue.,
874,9575688,motoz,Got this mobile yesterday. Great product. Battery is awesome as hell.. but whenever i put it on charging my is phone getting heated from the right side (where volume rockers and power button's are) the whole bar is getting heated but nowhere else..i dont know why.. is this normal ?,
875,4544137,motoz,The phone is an amazing value for money. The specifications are extremely great as per industry standards. The mods overpriced but are very useful as an addition to the device. The phone do reach a temperature of 41'C on a long charge but it doesn't seema that hot and the usual temperature on handling the phone normally remains below 32'C. The phone has amazing features and expects two more OS updates thats is Android O and N. There will be a number of variety in its add ons with time and will make it a great deal.,
876,8040394,motoz,Moto Z Play is a too good product. But don't try to buy on Amazon. Mobile booked on 26th October was & delivered on 30th Oct since they were postponed everyday by saying it will be delivered in next 24 to 48hrs. I called them more than 20 times & Email them as well but the standard reply I was receiving. When I have insist them to courier by any how on Monday 30.10.2016 with total cash back then the have delivered my order that also without fulfilling the preliminary request of change in address though it was confirmed by Amazon Representatives.,
877,7531283,motoz,Shipment is too late. Never got parcel this late. Phone is good till now . But back side of camera get scratches very easily. After a week my back camera got so many scratches. Build quality is questionable .,
878,8087284,motoz,It's not value for money. I have been using it since one week and it starts hanging now. I am not satisfied with the product. It looks good ultimate battery life but it hangs a lot.when I use hike and tap double to nudge then it does not respond to nudge even after I turned on the nudge on double tap in the hike setting.So I don't think its value for money.,
879,1517012,motoz,Phone gets heated up during charging.,
880,2422834,motoz,Side volume buttons and power button looks bit small but once we get used to it is fine.,
881,5609006,motoz,Back camera (main camera) is average... Did not see much clarity ... It's average only. I am bit disappointed with the camera performance.,
882,7910848,motoz,Moto Z Play is awesome in any views. Only do the one thing kindly make modes price less. Example camera price around 20K in that price I will go through with DSLR Camera. Mobile price is OK but modes price not satisfied. Still I found only one issue is there heating so much only while charging.,
883,9278092,motoz,Do not even think about it this is the perfect phone. The display is very nice works in the sun. There is no lag in anything the back covers are gorgeous the build is very premium feels like a flagship the camera is very decent ergonomics are good the phone lasts a day with very heavy usage and it's Made in India.,
884,5058195,motoz,) Camera: Beautiful. The primary cam takes excellent pictures in daylight as well as artificial light or low light. The amount of details captured at pictures taken at night with artificial light is just something I'd not expected.,
885,2398854,motoz,The front cam isn't behind by any means. It captures selfies that make you feel satisfied and proud of your phone.,
886,8551369,motoz,2) Battery life: Is this real?? Yes it is.. I remove my phone from charging at 630 am and with 4G internet connectivity on GPS on atleast 2-2.5 hours of bluetooth music playback full brightness and descent regular usage at 10-11 pm the battery is still at 50%+. And the turbo charging capability lives up to its expectations.,
887,3435999,motoz,3) Design: brilliant.,
888,7921544,motoz,4) Innovation: Moto Mods compatible. I'd say future-proof. Although I'd not spend on any of the current Moto Mods as they are not really worth the price tag in my opinion.,
889,7789940,motoz,5) Display: The AMOLED display produces good colours and resolution. Although the reds in pictures look too bright at times but I personally enjoy this display.,
890,9024186,motoz,6) Fingerprint Sensor: Quick and accurate.,
891,5455638,motoz,7) Build quality: Solid.,
892,6264476,motoz,8) Music quality / Equalizer: Exceptionally good.,
893,8932882,motoz,9) Performance: Wondering why this is last?? That's because I don't play games nor I find myself in need to be running many apps simultaneously. Although whenever I've pushed the Snapdragon 625 on this phone it has not,
894,9774588,motoz,It's been a week now I own this phone. I am not writing considering too much of technical details. My feedback are purely on the basis of an user experience point of view.This is what I felt.,
895,4141120,motoz,Pro:,
896,6201243,motoz,1) The internal hardware is superb. The specs just justify the performance. No delay no lagging no such concept of slowness yet.,
897,9171661,motoz,2) The touch is super sensitive and you will simply enjoy the experience and will be involved in that.,
898,8884748,motoz,3) The display is amazing with vibrant colors.,
899,3358603,motoz,4) The battery is best in all Android phones. It does take almost two days to recharge again. By the way my Wifi and Jio 4G is always on. Still towards the end of 2nd day only you will need to charge. So this is just awesome.,
