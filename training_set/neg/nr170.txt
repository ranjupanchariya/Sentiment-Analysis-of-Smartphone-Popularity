cons.NOOOO OTG Support... You cannot connect your pendrive. No gaming controller... No mouse...Internal memory is 10GB flat... Nothing more.
The phone does support external memory card, But that too is an Hybrid slot !!! Meaning either a memory card or a second sim. People who wish to use Airtel and Jio bad luck... Also phone doesn't support VoLTE... Means no voice calls in 4G without internet. While Moto G4 series owners are lucky and well equipped for this.RAM management is bit bad.. One in four apps that you reopen from recent apps will stutter and lag a few seconds before opening. Overall the phone is quite snappy and handles all tasks very well. Games also perform good. If you are willing to accept and adjust with the features which are missing and annoying at first, then.. This phone would be a great buy for 10,000rs. Seriously better that Xiaomi in the long run. Recommended.
