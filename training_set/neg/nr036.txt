I wanted to love this phone but having a screen that clicks just was not a good design.  The mere fact that you have to press, then let go to register a click makes it inherently slow. Plus you cant type without making a lot of racket, like during a business meeting or at the movies.  Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body, allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone!  On some on the shipped storms, clicks were not registering on the outer edges of the screen, necessitating uses to stuff paper, etc. in the battery compartment to make the storm work correctly.  Are u friggin kidding me? lolThe worse part of typing is actually the keyboard software itself.  Try typing any combination of numbers and letters and you are in for an experience.  Too many button presses are required to alternate between numbers and letters.  Touch screen keyboards have been around for ever.  You'd think RIM would give you something new that works well.  The storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as my old win mobile on screen keyboard from years ago.If you are use to bb's with a trackball, you are going to find navigating the storm a pain.  Try scrolling any long page.  It takes forever.  Maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm, or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.I wont even mention the slow camera, check error, random reboots, slow accelerometer, bad browser, etc since those things may get fixed if they haven't been already.  Just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone.  It's simply not going to happen.I'll be using the bb curve until verizon release the bb storm or the palm pre.
