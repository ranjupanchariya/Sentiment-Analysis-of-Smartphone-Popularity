I have bought nexus 6 in January. since the the phone is getting auto reboot. and after visiting service center 4 times, now my cell phone is in service center for a month. Motorola is just postponding my date of delivery of cell phone. The customer care is of very low level of management. Even the service center nor the Motorola company knows when my phone will be getting ready as they are just delaying the phone's delivery time day by day. Even you will be assured by the Motorola customer care that they will be helping you in all the possible ways but they will not and will not ever. Such a low level of management. I recommend never ever buy a Motorola product, because they provide thing with great looks but low level of inner system
