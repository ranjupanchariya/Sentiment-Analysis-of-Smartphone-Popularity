Have used over 5-6 mobile phones, but this has to be one of the worst ever electronic products I have ever used. Just a 2 feet drop and the screen became powdered. Such a pathetic thing, Replacement is 75% of the cost of the phone. So they mean to say that the phone is just the screen. Such a bad thing to know. I have used more than 4 Motorola phones and have loved everyone of them, but not any more. Breaks my heart and just 20 days of the purchase of the phone.
