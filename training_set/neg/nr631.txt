Bought it after seeing the features & spec. But I must say that the product is so so.. Great disappointment for primary camera. Charge retention is also very poor in terms of new phone with 3500 mAh . My existing Samsung Grand (which has been exchanged) exert such charge retention with 2200 mAh battery & found good camera performance even after 3yrs. More over heating issues are very disappointing while using data / camera. Otherwise performance of cpu with 4gb ram is good. Before buying I expected to give 5 stars . But very disappointed to put only 3 stars
