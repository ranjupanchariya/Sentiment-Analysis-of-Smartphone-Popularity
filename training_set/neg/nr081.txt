I own a lava pixel V2+ mobile which is bought from abroad. Got a slight change in processor with 1.3ghz clock speed and front camera reduced to 5mp. Other features are same as pixel V2. But,sometimes touch screen is not responsive. we have to touch 3 to 4 times to type or select an item and also reliance jio sim is not working even though it support 4g. Why this happened? It is just 1 month old. So I never suggest anyone to buy this phone. Try other trusted brands like samsung,motorola etc...
