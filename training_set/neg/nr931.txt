Intially i thgt the tthe phone to be very gud. But later on the very 2nd day its loud speaker mode malfuctioned during the calls. After we informed by a flipkart executive to factory reset it, it was gud for few days. But after some time its volume had malfunctioned sometimes it used to go up and sometimes down. Mostly down. And the loud speaker mode during calls had started again. GUD phone but bad product
