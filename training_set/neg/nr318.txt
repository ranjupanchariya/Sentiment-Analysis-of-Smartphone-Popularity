I've been a fan of Motorola products but this unit is driving me crazy.  The battery life is terrific.  That being said, it doesn't interface nicely with my Droid X.  It does play music from my phone through my car speakers and if I had any interest in that I guess I would be happy with it's performance.  Supposedly you just push a button and it will ask you what command you wish to use.  Well, sometimes it does that.  Sometimes it does nothing and sometimes it dials whatever the last number I dialed was and will continue to do that until I turn it off.  Disappointing is the mildest accolade I can apply although abysmal does come to mind.
