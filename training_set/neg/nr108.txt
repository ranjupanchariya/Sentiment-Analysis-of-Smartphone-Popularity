Guys, in simple words- Dont purchase this BULL-SHIT ever.My experience:Bought this phone in May 2014 after 2-3 months suddenly the battery didnt last long then there came network issues and finally the phone gave up. On visiting the customer service centre- they said that there is moisture in the phone. We have NO idea how this can happen as utmost care was taken while using this phone. At the service centre we found more than 60% complaints of moisture andeveryone were frustated.Now the camera is not working and I am totally fed up.If you still dont belive me or wish to research more then please visit any of the customer service centre and you will find it yourself.I also request flipkart to please either warn or blacklist MICROMAX for selling such inferior quality phones.And Micromax please dont spend on getting Hollywood stars and Sponsoring Cricket series rather invest the same amount to improve your product and customer service quality
