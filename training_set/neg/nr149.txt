Please guys..dont ever buy it. With in 5 months of purchase from flipkart, my turbo got touch problem. I submitted to services centre, they somehow cleared the problem and i got my phone back after 3 weeks, but since then its showing problem in touch while charging and some glitch in display. But today (With in 9 months) the display is totally off. Restarting phone is not helping. I am just sick of Micromax and its service...
