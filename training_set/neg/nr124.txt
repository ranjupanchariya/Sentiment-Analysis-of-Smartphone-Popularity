i read lot of review before buying turbo.i was having plan of ordering from flipkart only but friends made me to buy from near by showroom unexpectedly price is almost same in showrooms.only thing is insurance they are doing extra that cost also negotiable if we bargain well after oneday use i didnt like the phone.bcz of the battery as a new user to android i was not aware about many things in android then i have did some power saving tricks i ve downloaded battery applications too they are working so well then wen i compared those features with other phones its really awesome  i bet you wont get with these feature in any other model for this much cost.now i love my phone alot.
