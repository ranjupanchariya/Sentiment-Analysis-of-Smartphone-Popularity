Hardware: This phone was never able to boot up nor shutdown. It was on an continuous update and restart mode. I could not even power down. Effectively some piece of crap. Flipkart Customer service: Pathetic. When complained to them about the problem, they assigned a wait time of 20 hrs, after which their support team will call to check. Support team had no answer in explaining as to why someone should wait for 20 hrs.
