Bought this phone for 19k (at tht point of time it was their flagship phone, Knight was not there then) .... didn't even work for 7 months in total .... it stopped working 2 months ago suddenly .... since then i'm following up with their service centres to no avail ... guys save ur money ,,,, dont go for micromax ... especially ... costlier ones ... rest is up to u to decide
