ros : Hardware specs are great.Cons :-Phone is too big-Software is terrible. Android has so much great features, Samsung/VZW handicapped it for the \"General Public\". OS is filled with Verizon and Samsung bloatware. No way to remove them without rooting. Can't wait until bootloader is unlocked so I can switch to custom ROM.-There is no way to toggle between 3G/4G LTE. Sometimes if the 4G signal is very weak, you would be better off with 3G speeds. But the phone doesn't switch or allow user to switch to 3G in such cases.-There is much more.... mostly OS related. Looking forward to custom ROMs.
