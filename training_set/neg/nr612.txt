Has Blackberry not learnt anythingfrom the Z10 epic fail. The cost of that phone has nearly reduced to half of its original selling price. The marketing guys at Blackberry really need 'Professional' advice. Come on it's not rocket science guys that a cell phone which has a complicated User Interface, next to none applications and nowadays as the fad is going Quad Core. People don't expect their 35k+ smartphone to be running on a Dual Core CPU. It solely depends on the phone as a matter of fact(Nokias work fabulously on Dual Core). Secondly I appreciate BB giving us a 2GB RAM but....arrgh do you have anything which requires more than 1GB of RAM.The phone at least needs one highlighting feature which sets it apart from all the competition in the market.For eg:1. The HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia Z1 have fantastic Cameras.....hell even Gionee Elife E7 has a great cam too.2. I've already mentioned my disappointment with the processor.I do like the fact. I wish all the best to Blackberry with the phone. I also think there will be a rapid decrement in the price and this phone will be available in the sub 25k region if not the sub 20k region.
