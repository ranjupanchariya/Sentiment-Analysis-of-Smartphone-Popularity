I bought a Nexus 6 32GB on 4th Feb 2015, not even in one and a half month, the phone is diagnosed with a motherboard problem. When I contacted flipkart customer and asked for a replacement they said that since one month is over we can not trade this for a new phone. The phone is turned out absolutely functionless now. Biggest fraud to ever have encountered ever is flipkart. 0 for customer satisfaction. I would recommend never to buy anything from this e-commerce site. Specially things such as phone, I have seen my cousin entrapped by this thing earlier but turned out a idiot to still trust flipkart for a purchase. The most pathetic exeperince.
