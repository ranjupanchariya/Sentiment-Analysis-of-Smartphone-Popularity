Bought this phone with a great expectation.Fell flat on the day 1 itself when the phone got heated drastically while configuring and later when charging.The trend continued with a 30+ minutes call and browsing a 15 min video.Customer care response was like a broken record based on some remote test done.My online shopping with Flipkart ends here unless they return this phone and give me back my hard earned 35000 bucks.
