This is not a good phone, though the specs looks good on paper the performance is not even matching any low end branded phone. I tried the gaming on this phone and moto g , moto g performs better, I have had a very bad experience with micromax service, they are the worst. they take two months to repair a phone under warranty. I wasted my money on this phone and then again the display is costlier than nexus , they charge 7000.
