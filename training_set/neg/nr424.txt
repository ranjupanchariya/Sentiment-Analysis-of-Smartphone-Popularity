Please do not buy OPPO Phones. about 15 months back, I bouhgt 2 OPPO Phones to my daughters on same day. Now both phones are not working and regularly hanged. When I went to OPPO show room at III Block, Jayanagar, Bangalore, they told me to change the mother board which costs about 3200 bucks. Why should I pay that much, if i add little amount, I get a new smart phone, though it is a basic one.
