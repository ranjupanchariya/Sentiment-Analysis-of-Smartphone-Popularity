I anxiously awaited this phone for a couple months, the day finally came and the phone arrived and what a disappointment it was!I spent about a week trying to \"get used\" to the feel of the phone, i really gave it every effort but the phone just didn't work the way it should have.  I know there have been software releases to make the phone work the way it was intended but I just didn't have the time to invest in it.I'll make this short and to the point, if you're a business/power email user then this phone will cramp your style, try it out for a week or two and you will see.  Numerous times buttons on the screen were accidentally touched and the camera would come on and different things would activate.The screen rotation system was horrible with a 3-5 second delay from landscape to portrait mode not to mention the phone is just awfully slow.And keep in mind, this wasn't just my phone, i ordered over 5 of these and everyone complained about the same thing, all were sent back.  Even now, a few weeks after the release people that have them still seem disappointed but are \"stuck\" with them.This would make a great phone for your teenager still in school, but if you use a BlackBerry to make deals happen and to manage your day then this phone is a sad disappointment!!
