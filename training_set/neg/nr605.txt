Oh no! Tried it, well, here's my review...It doesn't look great, kinda like a 4-5 k handset, OS is kinda bullshit, no capacitive keys, battery not great, front camera just sucks big time, not so great rear camera either, less ram, only 1 gb free, others I forgot.On the other hand, some useful apps, great audio output, excellent security, I'm sure it will protect you against all adwares n malwares, excellent option to turn your screen either blue white or warm white.All in all, this is definitely an outdated phone, wouldn't recommend to buy this phone, unless blackberry introduces a 2016 version... My unit especially has problems with battery and performance, none the less, THIS IS OBSOLETE...
