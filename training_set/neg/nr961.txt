Physical: Frankly phone is getting bigger by bigger but anything bigger than this I can't imagine. With 5.9 inch quad hd display the phone is very big but the erganomics will make you not realise this with curved shape. The problem is it's good in terms of holding but while placed in table and you wanna text it will be annoying. Performance;With top notch specs the phone is pretty smooth doing anything you throw. There will not be no lag no delay in multi tasking,intensive gaming and all. The only thing i found is the phone gets warm very quickly. If you using it on 3g or 4g and or a intensive browser or gamer the phone will be like the iron box switched on. Let's talk about the display : if you are a gamer or you consumer of multimedia more then this phone will not disappoint you in any aspect. The display is really really awesome. Battery: with 5.9 inch AMOLED quad hd display the phone will lasts one day with moderate use without any tension. There is quick charging option which is very useful. And this supports wireless charging also. There is some strange sounds coming from the quick charger I got. Camera. No nexus phone has a good camera. But it is indeed improved from its predicissor nexus 5. Like wise it is and it is not the camera you will see in moto x 2nd gen. The support: you will have to use it with care. Ones it is dropped the display will brake no doubt. The accessories of Motorola are very costly and display will cost you half of the phone. Second one is support from motorola is good in this case but not Flipkart if it is on one month return policy. They didn't replaced my phone as I have informed them this heating isuue.
