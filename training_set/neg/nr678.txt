I recently purchased this phone (Asus Zenfone Max 2016) and can't use Jio sim in it. it is a 4G phone, but still i cant't. i can surf internet, but whenever i'm trying to call someone from Jio4GVoice app, data connection automatically got disconnected and call disconnected after that. other person is having just a missed call alert on his/her device. if anyone don't wanna call from Jio, then go for it
