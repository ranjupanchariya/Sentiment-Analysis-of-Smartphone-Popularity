I will keep it short and sweet ..... The camera has a BIG issue with optical image stabiliser ! Battery drains out like lose stomach and the phone at times goes on its own roller coaster ride , starts typing msg on its own dial numbers randomly at that point you have to re boot the phone to calm it down .......... This is my two day experience of this 49,000/- rupee phone ! Had to return it back the 3rd day ........ Not recommended .
