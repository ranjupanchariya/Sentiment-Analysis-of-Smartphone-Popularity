The bb q5 is a bad phone. Bought it 3 days back. worked ok for one day, after that the phone started to warm excessively, and then ultimately died a natural death as it could not be switched on nor can it be charged.The red and green light both glows when charging and that also stops after sometime and the phone does not respond at all. A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BY BLACKBERRY SOLD ON FLIPKART. The technical team of flipkart is also useless as it is unable to contact me and settle the dispute. I want a full refund and an apology from flipkart for selling a compromised product.
