Flipkart selling SPOILED MOBILES. My in-law has bought ASUS Zenfone 2 (Rs. 15k) as a gift for me in July. It got spoiled in 1 month and I had to roam around service centers for over two months to get return of my money since service center couldn't solve the problem after 2 repeated services. After I got that money I have bought Nexus 6 just a month back and it is already not working. This is pathetic, worst scenario I'm in. Over last 6 months I'm devoid of using any smartphone as every time its either not working or is with service center.  Initially after one day of receiving my mobile, I kept a return. They turned down the request saying we dont have return policies on mobiles. Now I understand why !! Every mobile is very costly and I'm getting spoiled mobiles everytime. What the hell is this? They have this stupid policy of 30 day replacement and I kept a complain on 30+1 hour day, they say replacement time is over. WTH is this? Why the hell are you selling spoiled products to us? This is insane. 2 spoiled mobiles in 6 months and 4 months of torture with service centers. I need a quick resolution if at all you care for customers. I'd urge all of you guys to twice check if you are buying a product at Flipkart. DONT BUY products on Flipkart. I lost all my trust with Flipkart.
