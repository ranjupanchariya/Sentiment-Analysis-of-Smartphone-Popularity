The network gets lost itself again and again. It is selexted auto select mode in mobile network settings. So this is first shit. Battery back up: this is a big disaster as it cannot even retain half day. Whether you use 4G or normal mode, battery gets died. It takes time when you unlock the device. Backlit buttons don't light up.i reset the phone through settings and this again did not help.Tried to get into manual mode to do reset, it is all in CHINESE. It should have been in English.
