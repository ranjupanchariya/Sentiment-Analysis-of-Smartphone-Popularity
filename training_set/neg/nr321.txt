At first, this seemed like the best phone I could get from Virgin Mobile. I did not particularly care for HTC's Sense UI, but found it workable with some tweaks.Unlike the other, lower end Android offerings from Virgin, the PCD Venture, and the Chaser, this is a much better quality phone. The build quality is decent for the price, and it feels good in the hand. It has a tendency to get warm, but not uncomfortably so. It's reasonably fast, and the 3D display looks fantastic, although it strains the eyes.I loved it for a couple of days, when suddenly I began getting \"SMS errors\". The next day, the phone simply refused to make or receive any phone calls, even with full bars, despite several restarts, and restores. I was sad to have to let this one go, but maybe I got a dud. Worth giving a shot if the gimmick of a 3D display seems worth it to you. I ended up settling happily on the Samsung Reverb after this.
