Not enough internal storage. I don't have a lot of apps but my phone is full and won't allow apps to update. Fast phone. love the 4g, plays most games, decent screen size and resolution. 3d actually works though I have no real use for it. speaker is decently loud, works well with skype. Only complaint is storage is bad on this.
