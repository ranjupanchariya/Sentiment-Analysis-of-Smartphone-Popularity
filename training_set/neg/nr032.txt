Good Stuff+ The phone itself has all the typical features I need+ The battery is NiMh so less memory effects and less environmentally unsafe than NiCad+ The unit is small and very light+ The headset sits on top of the antenna when not in use and I think that's pretty coolBad Stuff- The audio quality is just ok. It's not as good as my regular old cordless handset that has jack for a headset- Buttons are small- Build quality seems to be pretty flimsyI think it comes down to value. The Plantronics Cordless Headset Phone (CT14) does what it's supposed to but at almost $100 it doesn't offer any compelling features and may in fact provide fewer features and poorer quality at a higher price than a good cordless handset and a headset (purchase separately)
