Phone is good in looks (sleek, attractive) with wider 6 inch display and Corning Gorilla glass. But too much pre installed applications (53 in number) which can't be uninstalled and consumes too much of memory (more than 500 MB of RAM) and battery (30- 70% battery drain, depending upon application used) which lead to phone heat up, hang ups and crashes. So, it is waste of money. Flipkart do provide return policy, it only provides replacement option that too within 7 days of purchase. I regret buying
