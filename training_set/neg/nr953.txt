I got this & own a Nexus 5, which I love greatly. Please bear in mind that the colors on N6 screen are over saturated. Google it "Nexus 6 display color saturated" or similar. I am very disappointed bcoz of this. If you like N5 display, which is balanced, you wont like N6 display. Otherwise, if you are fine with the phone size, no prob at all w/the phone. Good speed.
