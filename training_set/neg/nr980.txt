After using it for a month or so I have just one thing to say! Except the Lollipop version of Android that runs this beast, it doesn't truly offer "More Everything". After using the 32GB Moto X (2nd Gen) if feel that the Nexus 6 is plain overkill. The Moto X is a better phone in many regards. For 44K I would not suggest anyone except the hardcore Nexus fans to get this. Battery life and Camera performance leaves a lot to be desired if you are coming from Samsung or Apple, but they do cost more as well. Also interestingly the Moto X features a better build quality when compared to the Nexus 6. The Nexus 6 back panel seems less premium being very plasticky and creaks on applying mild pressure such as when wiping smudges off of the somewhat glossy back. In the end it's all about whether you want a phone that just works beautifully for the price or one that is larger and more expensive just for the sake of it. The Nexus 6 isn't a practical device for people like me who have a rather active lifestyle since this thing neither fits into the pocket comfortably nor is it easy to grip with one hand. Except Dual Front facing speakers, OIS and Higher internal specs it's not offering "more everything" in terms of day to day usage. Plus the SoC used isn't 64-Bit so the actual 64-Bit goodness that comes with Lollipop won't be realized with this Nexus. Better luck next year if you were expecting to join the 64-Bit bandwagon!
