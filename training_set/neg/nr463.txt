It has a cheap and plastic feel. Awful camera, really. Pixels lie bare on your face the moment you pinch zoom your picture. After few minutes Wi-Fi gets disconnected. Though uninstalling the update resolves this issue.Very unresponsive fingerprint sensor. What's the point of having a fingerprint sensor if it's gonna take one minute to unlock the phone using it.Play store denies the installation of some apps. Honestly, it's the problem with most phones from Karbonn, Lava, Intex, and companies which thrives on low-end phones.Awful touch, not smooth at all.Boring interface. I mean it has the interface similar to those phones from 2013 running on Gingerbread.
