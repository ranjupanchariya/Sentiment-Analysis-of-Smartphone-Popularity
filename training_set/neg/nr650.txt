I bought the device in DEC 14 and it started to show issues within a month. The charger stopped working and the slim slot 2 did not detect the sim card. I submitted the handset for repair on FEB 15 and and its been almost a month for its repair. The handset is with HTC for a entire period and I am getting same answer repeatedly from HTC that the part that needs to be changed will take time to procured.I suggest not to buy HTC at all
