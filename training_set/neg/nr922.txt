I recently borrowed the nexus 6. In the first delivery they give me the defective piece, when I asked for the money they denied quoting its against the policy. I was forcefully asked to get the replacement. I thought I got a better one, still don't trust, it could be used one or the again defective (fingers crossed). Today I purchased the cover for this phone and i see it doesn't fits this phone. Either the phone is not good quality or the cover. I am sick of these guys. Almost ruined my 3 weeks in this bad quality service as well as products
