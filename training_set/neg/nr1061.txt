A big disappointment from Flipkart bought Nexus 6 on 22nd of feb, when I opened the packing I found the product with full of scratches on its display, I really got shocked & found its a refurbished product,I requested for a replacement but the rep from Flipkart told me there is no replacement product available but I found the product is available in Flipkart for my pincode & the rep said he will refund my money within 8 businesses & I got my money in 5 days but I don't know why u ppl sending a refurbished product as new one by showing it as an offer, instead u can mention it as refurbished.Totally disappointed with Flipkart and WS retailer.
