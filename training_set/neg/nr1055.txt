It's pathetic service by Flipkart. Delivered faulty product & not ready to get it repaired or replaced.It never started & stuck in Google logo.. Motorola service center is not ready to repair, they asked to get it replaced or rectify through flilpkart. Feeling cheated & completely helpless.Never ever buy from flipkart.
