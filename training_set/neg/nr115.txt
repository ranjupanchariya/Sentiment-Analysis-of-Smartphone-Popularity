if you go by the features of this phone, this will mesmerize you. I am really really depressed by this phone now. It is not even been a month and this Micromax Canvas Turbo A250 hangs a lot. It is my recent purchase and I have had many users of Micromax around me so finally I was convinced to have Micromax and leaving behind Samsung. But I made a big mistake to purchase this set. I will never recommend Micromax to anyone now. When I put a complaint against this set to exchange with a new set, the seller refused it.
