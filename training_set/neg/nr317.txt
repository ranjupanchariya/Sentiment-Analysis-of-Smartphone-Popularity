I purchased the Motorola S9 about 2 months ago, and it worked fine for about 1 month.  Then the buttons stopped working consistently, and finally stopped working all together.  I got agreement from Motorola to replace the headset under warranty a month ago, and shipped it back and still not headset.  When I called I got the typical call center garbage, putting me on hold, disconnecting the call, etc.  Finally I got someone on the line and they claimed that the headset is out of stock and that is why I did not receive it yet.  They never notified me of this, and when I asked when it would be in stock I was told they did not know, but I could call back in a week.  I told them that was not going to be OK, and then they claimed to have resubmitted my order and I would receive it in a week.  We shall see...Do not buy this headset, many people have had trouble with the buttons  and customer service has been terrible getting this remedied.
