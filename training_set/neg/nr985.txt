Got this phone twice and both the times the back panel had smudges. The screen guard had bubbles. Beware with this product. Hope flipkart is not involved in sending refurbished items stating them new. Got this product twice and both the times had the same issue plus headset was defective. Flipkart has however refunded my money but had a bad experience. 23/3/16 - Just now checked the last synced status of this phone and it was earlier used by some one in US. I bought this phone(replacement) post 7th March 16. But the phone was registered on 7th March 16 in US. I am sure I am not gonna buy anything from flipkart and will also suggest all my family and friends about it.
