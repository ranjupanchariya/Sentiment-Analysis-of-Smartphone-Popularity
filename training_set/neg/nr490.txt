Lets all admit it, the HTC One M8 is a very slippery phone.  Its super sculpted and just a marvel of industry design but... the curved back and brushed or painted surface has made this aluminum beauty slick.  Super slick...Also being aluminum its just super soft.  The metal is soft and I've seen review and sample units are just beat up to hell.  A simple drop could spell DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDOOOOOOOMMMMMMM.  So you want to protect it...however you don't want to cover up the beauty of your device!So this covers both.  While I don't feel like it'll protect your phone as well as the Slim Armor line from Spigen (or any other heavy duty brand) the clear shell will show off your phone just fine (Silver M8 owner btw).  The strong flex is also pretty grippy and won't just slip from your hands.  The cut outs are perfect BTW unlike some other cases you can buy these days still with awful cut outs for your phone.  Also being clear this one (vs the Slim Armor) can use the IR Blaster.  Also this case will raise your screen by a few mm just like the slim armor when its facing down.  And yes it comes with a free screen protector making this thing great value for the money.The only issue?  Its not true clear.  It has a ting of yellow to it.  So if that is something that bothers you, you might want to reconsider it.  Also remember that its a minimum design so don't expect that much protection for it.
