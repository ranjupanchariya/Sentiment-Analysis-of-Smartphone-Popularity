I purchased this phone on 02.01.2015 from flipcart. Phone is great with all the promised features. however, during charging through charger provided with the phone, phone gets heated. It even gets heated during calls even for a short period. U will literally will feel hot once u make a call. There was no apps running in background and phone got hot. i do not know this is a problem with my phone or is a general issue. I may go for a replacement if the issue is not resolved by moto in the comming days.
