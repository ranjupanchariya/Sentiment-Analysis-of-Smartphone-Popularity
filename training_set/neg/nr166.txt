First and foremost is....Dual sim and 128 expandable memory..Here this is bit tricky...You can use only two cards in the phone Sim1 and Sim2OR Sim1 and Memory card. Just any two cards. I felt this is drawback in the phone.for single sim user this is ok but not for dual sim card there is no memory card space in the phone. For thsi option i can give 3 star
