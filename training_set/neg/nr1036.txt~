Flipkart first; always considered it to be a poster boy of Indias ecommerce story. However seems they have a lot of distance to cover. Problems right from delivery stage. Yes, the product was delivered within the stated timeframe – but this was only after a lot of follow-up. Received a message from the Logistics (eKart) folks, that product would be delivered to me on a specific date. However no attempt was made to deliver at my home. Instead, they tried to contact me on my cell – and since I was in a meeting for about an hour, my phone might have been Non-reachable – no delivery was done. No attempt was made to contact me in any other time slot. The Call Center folks had no clue as to when a delivery reattempt would be made. Requested them to try the next day, but for obvious reasons nobody could commit to it. As my luck would have it, product was not delivered the next day either. Finally after a lot of follow up, my phone was delivered another day later. That was delivery, now for service. Unfortunately, I was facing some issues with the phone. On the 4th day I raised a service request with the Flipkart team, and they assured me that the relevant technical service team would give me a call back. Now starts the service nightmare. Absolutely no call from the technical team. Each day the call center folks promise that the problem would be addressed within 24 hours, but has been more than a week and not a single call. No resolution. Reverse logistics and service is challenging, and Flipkart definitely needs to pull up their socks on this one. Still hopeful they might call me some time. Now for the phone; I was really looking forward to this phone. Its a beauty, but has some issues (which could be limited to my piece also). Biggest cause of concern is Overheating. And I mean – Brick Hot. This is when I have not installed any apps and phone usage is minimal. Another challenge is battery drain – even with just a few calls the phone tends to discharge within a few hours. Again without any Bluetooth/ Location/ Apps being fired. Charging is also a problem. The Quick charger provided conked off, and any alternate normal charger seems to take ages to charge this mobile. Inspite of all this; I wouldnt might saying – I do not wish to change this phone. I only hope the Flipkart folks are able to reach out to me and fix the issues. Want to keep this phone as my primary work-horse for more time to come.
