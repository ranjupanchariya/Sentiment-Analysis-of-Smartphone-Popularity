I purchased the S4 less than 30 days ago.  The phone is beautiful and feels great in the hand.  Andriod runs great and Samsung's touch wiz works well.  However, if you purchase this phone you MUST use a case, and not just any case.  Stay away from the Samsung flip cover case that they recommend.  It's useless.  I dropped my phone less than 12 inches onto a tile floor.  I picked it up seeing only a small blemish in the top right corner of the phone.  However, the internal LCD was damaged rendering my phone useless.  I have never owned a phone so fragile.  In fact I have been able to own iphones in the past with no case at all.  I hate otter box cases because of thier ugly looks and bulkyness.  However, I don't see any alternative with such a poorly built phone.I would just stay away from this phone, unless your willing to buy insurance and use the biggest amost bulky case you can find.
