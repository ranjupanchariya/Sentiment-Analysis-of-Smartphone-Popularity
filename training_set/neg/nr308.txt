When you open the package, the phone box says to open in front of the delivery person and do not accept if seal is broke.That should be in the description on amazon. Seal was broken, I opened it anyway and everything was in the box. But when I started going thru the phones apps/programs the place and time was for Mexico City,?. Alarm clock does NOT WORK, poor volume, can't hear it ring even on high. Picture text NOT WORKING. Apps that are on phone (sim toolkit) can't find it google, day 3 I.M. Amazon for a rma and let them know that this phone is DEFECTIVE. But I really want this phone company to succeed, so I ordered another one just to make sure. I used at&t straight talk, did everything they say to do to make this phone work. Blu did email in 1 day, so I know they are trying to help every one. That in and of its self is why I am going to try another phone. I will let everyone know.
