I had odered this phone but was not satisfied so i returned it for a full refund.I received a refund of 43999 in my wallet account.I had went for a trip upon coming back when i checked my balance it was zero i asked the customer care for help and they say they refunded me by mistake.I had a faith on flipkart but now i do not intend to buy things from here .Flipkart has turned from good to worse
