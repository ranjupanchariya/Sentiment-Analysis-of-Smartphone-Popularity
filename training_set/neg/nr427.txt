oppo advertise this as camera phone.. but for camera i give it 4/10. Both front & back cam are poor .. i feel that these chinese phones doesn't take good pictures, they are jst trying to beautify pics by adjusting brightness etc. But when u zoom the picture u will see the blurr.. i am giving this review cus i wanted a very camera specific phone.. unhappy with It's camera.. i compare it with samgung grand max .. if i give grand max 7/10 then i give 4/10 to oppo. Very -very poor for camera..No one spend so much only for ram & internal memory..
