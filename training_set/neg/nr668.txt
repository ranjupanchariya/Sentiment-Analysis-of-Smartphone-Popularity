This is such a horrible mobile !! WiFi is not getting switched on !! but Bluetooth is always switched on !! I dono why.. the charge is eaten up fully by the Bluetooth!! Play store is not at all launching!! Pls don't but this mobile.. flipkart jus because we are buying a budget phone doesn't mean that u will deliver a low quality product.. u guys should get ur act together and work on QUALITY !! This 1 rating is only for the camera.. which is kinda OKAY
