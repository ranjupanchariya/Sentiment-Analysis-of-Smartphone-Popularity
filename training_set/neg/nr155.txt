Guys, i bought this phone in feb 2014. It hangs a lot, and after 6 months it got off unexpectedly. I take it to the service center and they gave me repaired handset after one month which was in a very bad condition. It was scratched and the front glass was of another color. At the service center i met lots of people who are having the same issue, So guys this phone seems like a Chinese android with a MMX branding. I suggest not to buy this phone, after sale service of micromax is not good. Go to the branded company phone like sony, nokia etc... Atleast they are trustworthy.
