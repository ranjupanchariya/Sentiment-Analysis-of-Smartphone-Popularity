I upgraded from Nexus 5 (LG). I pre-booked this phone and got is as soon as it released in December. I was happy with the phones performance. Bought it primarily for surfing, movies and games. Over a period of time phone started heating up when playing certain games. I ignored it considered that the games were processor intensive. In June, after the 5.1.1. update, the phone started to reboot automatically and shut down without any reasons. Later it would shut down when battery showed between 50% to 30%, and would not power up till connected to charger!! This continued for few days, and the Moto Call Center advised certain technical fixes, including rebooting the device. The problem was not solved. They advised that I give it to Moto Service Center for repair if required. That was on June 13, 2015. Till date (after one and half months) I have not received any update on my phone. I have called the Call/ Service Center multiple times and they inform that parts are not available, so repair is delayed!!! I asked them to replace the phone or refund my money. Nothing!! They just refuse, and apologize. This is insane!! What time of Company is Motorola?? Why did I buy this phone?? I believed in Google brand and then this happens. By the way Google Customer Care DOES NOT CARE!!! My emails to them has gone unanswered.
