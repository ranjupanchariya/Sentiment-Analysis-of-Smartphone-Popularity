Its been 3 months I am using my 9100G. I have been frustated by its performance, It hangs very often. First, Whenever I am outside in direct sunlight and I take out my phone it almost always hangs for 3-4 mins. Second, it hangs while using some apps like viber, profile scheduler etc. In these cases I need to restart my phone most of the time or need to wait for 2-3 mins. Also sometimes camera stops working and crashes. Then the phone needs to be restarted for using the camera again. Apart from hanging, it responds slowly sometimes which is not expected with 1.2Gh and 1GB ram. Samsung has integrated best possible specs in this phone but have not made the compatible software. Hope that ICS update improves its performance. Otherwise I will not recommend any samsung smartphone to anybody.
