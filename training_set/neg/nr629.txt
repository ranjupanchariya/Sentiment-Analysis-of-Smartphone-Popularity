I got this phone on 11 aug. It was working nicely. I had no problem with the phone. But yesterday it stop working on its own. I used the phone 5 min before that it was working and it is not I tried switch on but it did not respond. When I connect the usb cable the red notification light is on and that's all, nothing on the screen and phone doesn't respond to fingerprint. Then I put the phone in its box and packed it as today I going to its service center when I take out phone from box this morning it was very hot, like its burning. I am totally dissatisfied with the product.
