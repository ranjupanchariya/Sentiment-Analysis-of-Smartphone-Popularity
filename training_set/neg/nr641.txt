The phone heats up even when idle. Uncomfortable to hold. Poor battery, doesn't last a day. Worst camera in this price range. Flipkart denied return, denied the phone overheats. Lenovo says that overheating should be considered normal, whereas it is a serious health hazard. I emailed Flipkart Resolution, but received no response. All I am left with is 8k worth of overheating brick that I will not be using (or gifting). Will never buy from Flipkart and Lenovo ever again
