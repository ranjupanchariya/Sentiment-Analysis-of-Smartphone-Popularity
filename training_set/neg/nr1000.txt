The phone is alright, but post sale service is an issue. Flipkart is a big time cheat and has disgraced in the support of warranty. It says take it to the nearest service centre, which is 480 kms away from my place, and there is no assurance that it will be fixed at the earliest possible. Flipkart turned there back and said thats all we can suggest. Service team is equipped with idiots working for them. The phone switches off randomly and does heats up a lot.. Buy anything, but not on Flipkart..
