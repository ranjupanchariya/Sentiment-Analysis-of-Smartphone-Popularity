I am going to keep this short since I'm about to go to the Verizon store to replace the \"Storm\" (aptly named) with a Curve.  This phone is a disaster.  Very buggy, which while the bugs can be fixed with upgrades, will never fix the really (for me, at least) difficult to use touchscreen keyboard.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible not to touch a nearby key on the keyboard and that slows one down considerably.  I've tried, I really wanted this phone to be great given all the features, but can't stand it.  Also, if you want to use the keyboard, you have to go to menu, scroll down (should be a top menu choice) and then select \"Show keyboard.\"  That's an annoyance after being used to having a keyboard (a real one) right on the device.  When entering information into a field on a webpage, the keyboard does automatically come up.  But you have to tap exactly into the field data entry box on the page (good luck in doing that; you can magnify the page but then have to demagnify the page to view it after entering your text).  Just too user unfriendly and an enormous missed opportunity by RIM to create something great.
