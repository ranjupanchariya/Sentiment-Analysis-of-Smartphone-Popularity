Highly dissatisfied with my Nexus 6. Worked smoothly for a month or so and then started showing its true colors! Let me list down the problems I faced. 1. WONT CHARGE! Oh my! It does not charge! I have to unplug and plug the charger a number of times to check if it has actually started charging. Really annoying problem, this one 2. Hangs! Hangs like Windows systems! I haven't used Snapchat on this phone for so long.. I can use it only on a lucky day. It just keeps getting stuck. 3. "Camera not found" Oh boy! Now even the camera wont start, not to mention the sluggishness of the phone and the camera when it starts up 4. CANT CALL! I have to dial almost 5 times to make a successful call. This is NOT because of the network (since I used the same sim in my earlier Moto X2). It connects, waits for a minute without giving any tone and then drops. So irritating!
