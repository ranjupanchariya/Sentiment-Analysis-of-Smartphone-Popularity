HTC 816g is the worst phone one can expect at such a high price.I bought it for 18,000 INR and faced numerous difficulties:-1.The SIM Slot is very fragile and is designed in such a way that if it fails you will have to replace entire Mother board for 10,000 inr.My both SIM Slots have collapsed and the customer service agent charged 7000 INR.2.Camera quality is good but it interrupts.Sometimes camera will not function or there will be a blackout.3.The ear phone is also of inferior quality.It will last max for 1 year.4.The Sound quality is worst with sound cracking if volume is raised.5.Only 1 GB RAM you will face lags and interuptions during gaming.6.HTC Sense does not function properly you will have problems connecting to Facebook and all.7. Worst customer service..not many outlets pan india only in state capitals 8.Too high a price. It sucks in every aspect.I will never buy an HTC product ever.I would have given it a 0 rating if available.Totally frustated and shattered with my money not utilised.The only good thing is camera only if it works properly.
