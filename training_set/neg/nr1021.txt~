I think going with brands means better quality of product and better services. I spent a good amount on this phone. I faced some network issues in the phone so i gave my phone at service center. Now I am just following up with them for my phone with no satisfactory response from the service center or the customer care. Service is the true test of a brand and I don't find any point going with the brand who can't provide after sales service. If service is not available even in warranty period what will happen post warranty. They initially told to me that it will take 2-3 days, then it was told to me that the phone will be replaced if not repaired within 7-10 days. Now you call them only reply will be that phone will be provided within 2 days. If Motorola can't satisfy its high end customers, then what will happen with other customers. Now phone has became a compulsion in our life and finding it really difficult without phone. Extremely disappointed with Motorola.
