This phone is a good deal as you get a lot of phone for the low price, however make sure you have plenty of patience for them to even ship the phone!  Once you get it transferring contacts to it is very cumbersome.  It won't import from the sd card.  I feel like IOS and Android operating systems are more intuitive to use and have better app selection.  If you have a bigger budget get the Nexus 5 which is a LOT of phone for the money.
