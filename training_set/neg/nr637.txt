The phone is really good from all aspects except the major heating problem, which still remains even after the latest software update of 119mb. Phone gets heated within 3-4mins of normal usage and burns the ear if you receive or make calls. Rest the product is really nice. But this overheating problem being really intolerable, I am going to return the product.
