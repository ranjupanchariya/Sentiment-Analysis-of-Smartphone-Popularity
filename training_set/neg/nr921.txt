Nexus 6 is a great phone. Absolutely great display, speakers and everything. But with a severely flawed battery and processor. I live around a sunny region, (you know how it is in India) and the CPU temperatures kept shooting up, then throttling itself and lagging unbearably. This wasn't a one off but kept happening again and again. Battery was even worse than the nexus 4 (when it first arrived). And one day,the battery started expanding and the back cover started popping out. Returned this one and got a new one. After a few days of usage, all the same issues appeared again. I also saw reviews about the screen cracking "on its own" from the battery expansion. How can a manufacturer like Moto be so cheap with the hardware?? Nexuses use the cheapest hardware possible so be aware of this when you are spending anything about 20k, its not worth it at all. The phone shuts down at least thrice a day, mostly when you are on calls or doing anything battery intensive. Worst battery I've ever seen. After 2 phone replacements, refund rejects and a lot of fights with Flipkart support, (and also after purchasing Flipkart First so that they'd take me seriously) , they finally approved my refund request. 5 stars for Flipkart's priority support. If not, would've lost 35k on this piece of crap from Motorola.
