I bought Asus Zenfone 6 from Flipkart on 27/09/2014. I was using this phone for past 20 days and was satisfied with my overall experience. Yesterday my phone fell from a table(height 3 feet approximately) and the phone screen has cracked into bits.Though the LCD and touch option is still working fine,the cracked glass is pricking my fingers making it really difficult to use the touch functionality. I would have attached the image of my phone screen had Flipkart provided me with that option.I have mailed my complaint to Asus and waiting their response on same. I am expecting an replacement for this damaged product. Asus should not cheat its customers like this by providing low quality items.
