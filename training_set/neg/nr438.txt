I have Purchased a Intex Aqua 5.5 VR phone from Flipkart, the product is not good. Volume button is not working and frequent disconnect in Wi-Fi connection. I have raised return request two times for the product,they are not taking back. But in the adds Flipkart saying that easy returns when product is damage and not satisfied. There is no proper response from Flipkart customer care person. All are fraud people , please don't buy this product from Flipkart.
