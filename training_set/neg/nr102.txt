just bought a MMX phone but after 2 days of use charging of battery abruptly end and after 24 hrs of charging battery shows as 5% charge,I take it to service centre.where they took my phone after 20 days I am yet to get my phone back and what I notices that around 50 people were there and all had that same problem.I had very much expectations from MMx but unfortunately dissatisfied greatly due to phone and its service.
