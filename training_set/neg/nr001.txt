I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbersunder different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product. When's the new Treo coming out again?
