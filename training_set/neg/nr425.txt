Worst phone ever! Its been only 3 days I bought this phone for rs10000 .When they said its best among 10k I got really happy but after using it I feel like throwing it away.Everything is fine exept the stability.Hanging like hell .For 10k you could have provided atleast 2GB ram.Really dissapointed with this phone.
