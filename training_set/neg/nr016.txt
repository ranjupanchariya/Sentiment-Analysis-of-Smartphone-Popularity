One of the known problems with theBlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)is that using Bluetooth voice-command dialing can lock up the phone, requiring one or more reboots (remove the battery, wait 15 seconds, replace the battery, and wait 4-6 minutes). Many of my Storm problems were resolved by a Verizon support tech who had me use a command to \"wipe\" the device and start over again. I thought I'd start clean and use this headset instead of my Motorola, which is recommended by the Storm manual; the lock-up problem is better, but the phone still locks up occasionally.This headset fits more securely than my oldMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, but it takes considerably more pressure to press the control, and there is a longer delay between pressing the control and getting any response on the Storm. However, since it does seem to cause fewer lock-ups, I'll continue to use this BlackBerry headset.
