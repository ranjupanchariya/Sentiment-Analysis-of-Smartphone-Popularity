I bought Q5 phone a month back as I was needing for business purpose ( sending long mails, making multi party callsMy view is that in case this is going to be the first blackberry phone for you, do not buy this phone. It is very complicated to do even simple things like saving a number ( from your call list), sending a sms to an unsaved number, sending sms to multiple parties. It has rich high end features; but is very complicated for doing daily things like making call, making multi party call is like next to impossible, sending sms, saving number, importing numbers from your previous phone etc.I would not recommend this phone for any one who is new to blackberry for sure.
