This product is totally wastage of money. I never wanted to purchase set with Micro SIM and Non removable battery. No where this information was written on flipkart specification. I got two time display problem in my set . Display was totally blank although phone was running in background. I asked for replacement and I got the new product. But what about the situation if I get the same problem after 30 days because flipkart can't replace the product after 30 days. And it is very known Micromax customer service is pathetic. Guys before purchase this set make sure if you mobile hangs you can't correct it by own as battery is non removable. Always choose a reliable brand. This kind of set look very attractive but never stands longer. You may go for more reliable brand like Samsung and sony , not very attractive but very reliable.
