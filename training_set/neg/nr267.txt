with great expectation i brought this phone .. only because redmi's 1s front camera was superb even thought it was of 1.3 mp , and the clarity was like 8mp... in redmi 2s the camera is of 2mp and clarity is like of a vga camera i am very disappointed by this , i am going to sell this off and will stick to redmi 1s. and also apps get killed eg , torrents and tubemate .. just as they use to do in redmi 1s ,, cant understand the benefit of 64 bit processor ,, guys buy redmi 1s , if u get it..
