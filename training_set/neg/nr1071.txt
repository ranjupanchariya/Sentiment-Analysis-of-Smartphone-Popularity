We can exchange any product in COPORATE shops in india if we don't like within 7 days of buy outs. I got the new phone nexus 6 today. The moment I got the phone, I found it little bigger screen size (as I didn't mark so closely the screen size inch by inch the time I was ordering). I called to flikart and got reponse that the product can be refunded only on the basis of damage.... I requested to buy another product in lieu of this one but not agreed by flipkart.... I am regular buyer from flipkart but now I see real drawback of the same.... I have to change habit of buying now to only after physically looking at the product.... in size and colours...
