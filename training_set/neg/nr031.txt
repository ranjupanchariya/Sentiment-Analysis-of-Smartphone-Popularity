i bought one note. screen was gorgeous. update to ICS was quick and painless. i was very pleased with functionality. until i tried playing a few games. there was a definite lag. in fruit ninja, i would slice, and slice would appear a fraction of a second later. enough of a fraction that i would miss a lot. this happened in other games and where speed is important, this is just bad. and for me it was important. so i returned it. got another note. same thing. same lag. even a worse lag. contacts took time to load. it was just unpleasant. i will return this one as well.i will say this, screen is indeed gorgeous. video and audio were nice. but it is not good enough for a 540$ cellular. just not good enough.
