Micromax is the worst smartphone maker.....Moto G/E or anyother company's 5 MP camera is far better than Micromax's 13 MP camera!!! There are many other functions which do not stand fit in comparison with other smartphone! Micromax is totaly fraud!!If the product quality is good then why Micomax slashed its prices around 40 percent wihtin 6m months! I had baught Micromax A-250 at Rs.19300/- after one month of its launching.....and now check the price!!!
