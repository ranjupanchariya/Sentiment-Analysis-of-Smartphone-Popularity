I ordered this phone on jan 1st and jan 2nd phone was delivered. This phone is a beast I loved this phone there was no issues in the phone. Phone will heat up while charging that is because of turbo charger also while playing video or when you are on call for a long time. Yesterday phone slipped from my hand and it fell down and display was broken. u have to be extra carefull when u are handling the phone . I went to Moto service center they said that external damage and liquid damage does not come under warrante. they informed that spares are not available and the display replacement will cost around 25-30k almost 70% of the phone. Phone display is too large that if u drop the phone from 3ft of height display will break for sure and that was happened with me. waste of money . i wish they would replace my phone or replace the display for free of cost .
