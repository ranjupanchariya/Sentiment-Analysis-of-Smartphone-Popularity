I have been shopping since long on flipkart, brought this phone for myself and it was good for a while..however, suddenly there were signs of screen flickering and went blank..boom...all data lost....still phone is within 30 days period and hope flipkart will refund the amount... Still, Im under pressure; holding breadth and waiting flipkart to re-collect the phone, it was a terrible experience, I have no phone now and data lost like pics and documents are gone
