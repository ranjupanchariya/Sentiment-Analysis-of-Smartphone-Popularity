I bought this mobile on flipkart 1-1-2015, I have used this mobile for 4 months after that only i have noted that my back case is peeling off due to battery overheating. Then I searched in Google regarding this issue, most of the people got this problem and moto replaced the mobile who got this problem. I have contacted motocare they told me to step in B2X care solution which is authorized service centre of moto. I went there and gave my handset on 04-04-2015, they told with in 2 days you will get the replacement. Till now i dint get my product, daily i am going to that B2X store and spending 2 to 3 hrs and getting the comment tomorrow you will get it. Am so upset regarding this worst service of moto. cons: worst design, over heating.
