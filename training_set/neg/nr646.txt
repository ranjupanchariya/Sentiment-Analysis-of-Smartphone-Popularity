Previously had htc m8 worst camera then again chose htc and got 828 as im addicted to music quality and blinkfeed. nw ruined tat too headphone vol very low blinkfeed ful of bugs. Nwdays VR crazy no vr apps frm htc and with its unaffordable lab rat vive. And htc 828 no gyroscope to atleast try other vr..
