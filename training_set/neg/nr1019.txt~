Its horrible to notice that a flagship mobile lacks in restoring the OS when a disruption occurs.I was upgrading the OS from v5.0 to v5.1 with a hope that phone message will be enabled since had issue in sending message also installing few bank application.During upgradation process after 15 minutes I could notice that an escalation mark with a android symbol and a line stating " no command" is displayed. I tried to reset the phone by following moto site. But it has lead to a prolonged loop were application optimization was continuing.It never started with a normal recovery/ Factory setting defaults.
