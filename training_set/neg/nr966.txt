I bought the nexus 6 and was completely flattered by its amazing specs but now I wish I would have gone for any other phone other than this, I was an iOS user for the past 3 years and was looking for a change so I thought I would go for stock android. VERY BAD experience and also my screen broke because it was kept inside my bag, so much of gorilla glass 3.
