I loved this phone when I first got it. The interface, the design, the features. Just a great phone for a great price, or so I thought.It began to act glitchy the first month. I thought it was a fluke, so I did a factory reset and it seemed to behave fine again. Until I took it to Central America. Nokia's are known as global phones, so I figured I'd have no problem using this phone abroad. Wrong.When I got south of the Equator, things went haywire. The phone would not detect networks, and would not connect when they were detected. It would power off and on randomly, sometimes several times in a minute. The time and date were constantly being reset incorrectly, even when I manually input the time and date. The battery would not hold a charge. Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I'd be able to get and receive messages...sometimes...with the wrong time and date stamp. It was just acting...bonkers. The phone did not work correctly for the duration of my trip. I spent hours fooling with the SIM and battery and googling troubleshooting steps. Nothing helped.So I made several attempts to troubleshoot/repair the phone...and this is where Nokia loses major points with me...although the phone was well under warrantly, Nokia jerked me around for a month before accepting the phone for repair, only to advise me that the humidity in CA must have tripped the moisture strip behind the battery and therefore voided my warranty. Groan. Prior to that, Nokia repeatedly told me to return to the retailer or the carrier. Neither of those companies REPAIR phones, though, and once you're out of the 30-day return period, well then you're just out of luck.So now I'm stuck with a phone that's DOA and no hope of ever seeing my $150 back. Very disappointed.
