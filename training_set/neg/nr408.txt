Product Quality is premium. But it seems they have some issues with this product during manufacturing because when i got the phone and the problem of overheating absorbed on 5 or 6th day. i requested for replacement they send their technician. technician also find the same problem. then they replaced the product after replacement new phone also has the overheating problem from first day. Apart from that its too good product but because of balckberry love I will go for another blackberry product. Like Dtek 60 or Dtek 50 Or Priv. Do Not Go for this Product. Or go on your own risk.
