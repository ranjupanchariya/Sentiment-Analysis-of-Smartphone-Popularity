Hi, i don't want to comment on mobile specification side. Rather i would like to commenton how their focus towards customer satisifaction.I got my mobile broke down due to some reasons and i have checked in @ micromax service center, Bangalore for it's repair & made an order for a LCD Display kit of Canvas Turbo which got damaged. Even after placing an order, i had to wait for more than 20-25 days & the problem is not yet solved.I really did not understad their concept of selling the products without any backup plan of service.it's really disappointing from the service side..!!!
