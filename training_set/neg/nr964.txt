Got the phone on 10th Sept i.e. 5 days ago. I can say after 5 days that its not a good buy even at 29,900. The biggest USP of the phone is the QHD screen and it is not as vibrant as iPhone 6 plus, Note 4 or even samsung A8. The screen has some yellowish kind of effect, white is looking pale. The processor seems to be great on paper but it restarted four times itself in last 3 days, it may be some software glitch also. I don't like the midnight blue color also, perhaps I should have bought white one.  And most important thing, battery life is pathetic. Its better to buy moto g3 if someone like stock android feel and regular update.
