I purchased this as a gift for my sister-in-law for Christmas.  So she got it on the 24th of December and before long had the device up and running.  Once she transferred all her Google contact information the phone began to show it's true colors.  Because she has a tremendous amount contacts the 4GB 512MB of RAM was just overwhelmed and the phone began to shudder, freeze and just plain unresponsive. So 2 days later we returned the phone and sprung for a used Galaxy S2 from eBay
