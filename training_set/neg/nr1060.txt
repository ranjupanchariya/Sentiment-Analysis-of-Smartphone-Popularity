The power button's aren't working since the day I got my product. Thought it's a software issue, updated my phone and still the same problem. Then got to know it's a hardware issue. Got this product on the 28th of October, how do I use my warranty? AND MY PHONE FREEZES! WORST MANAGEMENT FROM FLIPKART EVER!!
