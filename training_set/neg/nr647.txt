Dont buy this phone as the touch and screen glass are very delicate and gets damaged, I bought 2 phones both have same problems, HTC service centers are not good, take a lot of time for repair about 30 days and also the spare parts are very expensive, I have received a quote of Rs 6500 for my phone display broken and even after one month HTC service center people have not repaired my phone, when we call their customer care they say, spare parts are not available in stock...Big shame to HTC
