I bought the phone on 27th January 2015, and a day back while I was trying to plug in my charger it just refused to go in. When I contacted the service station they said that the pin inside the phone has broken and I haven't even dropped the phone once. And apparently they don't even repair that part in warranty and the out of warranty cost for repair would be 70% of the cost of the phone. I mean are you kidding me? As 70% cost means approx Rs. 33000 And its not only me, there were more 5 customers with the same complaint, Why should the customer pay for no fault of the customer. This is really disappointing for customers as this is not what we expected from Mororola and Goolgle
