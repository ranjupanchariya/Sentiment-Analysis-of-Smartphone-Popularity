i have been using micromax after a brief use of samsung mobile until i purchased HTC 516, i was shocked to see a phone launched a year after my usage of micromax phone but still lacked the features of a micro max phone. i was really put off by the phones usage of internally memory as all apps r stored there and r non transferable. its no value for money and has outdated basic facilities.
