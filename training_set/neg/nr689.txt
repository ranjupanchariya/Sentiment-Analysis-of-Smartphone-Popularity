Dont buy this phone until asus fix its 4G connecting disconnecting issue. I purvhased it recently and found that you cannot use 4G net properly.. it continuously keeps on connecting and disconnecting.. you cannot call by using Jio4GVoice app.. dont consider this comment fake .. you can check in asus zenfone max forum..
