I ordered this phone on 12th Feb... got it the next day. On 14th Mar I dropped the phone from a height of not more than two feet and the whole display got cracked.... what is Gorilla glass doing here... I called FK cust care on the same day requesting assistance on my phone being damaged after a fall. I am given information of certain 'B2X Technologies'. On calling them... to my utter surprise they informed me that they dont service Google Nexus 6... What??? I called FK customer care again today and now i am asked to wait for 3 business days... imagine you dont have a spare phone and now you ask your customer to wait for 3 days to find out why the preferred service center declined my request. Thank God they didnt pitch me to buy a spare phone till they find out the service center.
