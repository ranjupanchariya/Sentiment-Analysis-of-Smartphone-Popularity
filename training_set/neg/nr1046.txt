I have ordered Google Nexus 6. The day I purchased it and started using the phone I started noticing that while charging the phone it heats up to an extreme level. I thought that the 1st & 2nd charge of the phone might generate this heat. I decided to use the phone for 2-3 days. Even after 3-4 days of daily charging and usage the overheating of the phone was not going away. I decided to return the phone and from that day I came to know how pathetic Flipkart Customer service is.
