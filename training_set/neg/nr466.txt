he phone is not usable, I bought the phone checking reviews, many were good reviews (with some bad reviews) bought it at 4500/- . was happy that i have bought it at good discount, on receiving it looks nice, screen resolution was looking nice with good colors and brightness. you can view it in under sun light. but on second day and after... there were problems problems and problems.It has tough issue, you will have to touch several times , It has mic issue, every one talking to me was saying... speak louder. camera is not good, front one is pathetic. sound is loud like cheap china phones, finger print sensor is okay. so bcz of all these problems i requested refund and flipkart approved it. after requesting refund, the next day its screen started flickering. i was happy that all this happened in 10 days.
