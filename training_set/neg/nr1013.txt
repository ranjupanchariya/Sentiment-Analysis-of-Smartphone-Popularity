I am from india new delhi. I recently bought motorola nexus 6, from flipkart. Within two months the speakers of the phone stopped functioning. I gave it to the service centre for repair, after 1 week the phone get repaired. Then after using the phone for further two months, the speaker stopped functioning again. The mic stopped functioning, camera of phone stopped working. The phone was also not connecting to pc. The phone keeps on rebooting itself. I gave the phone to the service centre on 14th of september, its been more then two weeks but the phone is not repaired yet. The service centre people keep on saying that we are waiting for parts to come. I am very disappointed from the services and quality of the product. I will never recommend anyone to buy a motorola product. The phone is a piece of crap. I will never buy a moto product again.
