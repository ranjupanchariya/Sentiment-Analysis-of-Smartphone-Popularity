I have submitted my Nexus 6 / 64 GB device to the service center (service centre is only having option of raising reauest to motorolaother than which they can't tell you anything else, if you push them they will ask you to speak to MOTO customer service, who again just have typical robotic answers which will obliviously don't solve the problem) regarding the following problems of:1. Battery discharging in a very short period;2. Device overheating while talking;3. Network not showing the device, while the SIM working in other devices.
