It was replaced on 9th August, Headphones were in the box. Then problem started again with the phone. Not hanging but poor signal strength to which, flipkart has answer that it is due to the service provider, and I should check it with other service provider. Which I did, as I had to go to a mobile shop. because none of my friends use other than airtel as the service provider. He also asked me to keep the settings to 2g as it has better signal strength, which is again one concern, If i have to use 4g then I have to toggle the settings and while making calls I need to go back to 2G. worst experience in last 2 weeks.
