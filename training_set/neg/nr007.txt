This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself.  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan.  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper.  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile.  Stay away from this ugly monster.
