Ear phone, Security options, Touch Sensitive..etc. doesnot work many times. I have spent 16000 for this mobile and gifted my fiancee for the first time. Its disheartning for me to get such a product from flipkart. Now that return option is also disabled on flipkart. My fianceee started using her old mobile. What I have to do with this mobile? I want to return it and get New piece. I dont want it repaired.
