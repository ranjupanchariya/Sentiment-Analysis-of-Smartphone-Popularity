Some people say it doesn't have external memory card slot. Yes that's correct but keep in mind that Galaxy S4 and all the iphones too don't have memory card slots. It's the idea of MMX to offer a phone with the same feature as other branded phones are offering. Also note that price is less and quality is much better then others. I have personally used the phone and I am really happy with the product n quality. People who are dumb don't find the difference between MMX with Samsung and iphone. If you buy iphone or S4 then you'll realize the importance of MMX. Giving 1 so it's posted on the right place.
