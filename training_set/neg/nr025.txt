The short of it:-The ringer has an inherent flaw in it and if it turns off on its own it will not turn back on without a hard reset.  This has happened to my phone and the ringer will only stay on for a couple of hours. Thus, every few hours I have to hard reset my phone if I want to hear it ring. Palm refuses to replace the phone and refuses to create a fix for it as it is a registry issue from what I have read on the Palm Forums.-Once the phone goes on roaming, I practically  have to reset it to get it off roaming.-I consistently use the comm manager to turn off and on wireless/cellular due to flying all the time and I often have to go through the motions two or three times to get it to actually execute.-The battery is ok for a smart phone.-The on board internet browser gets the job done for me.-The call quality has been fine and it rarely drops calls on me.-All my messaging capabilities work ok, though I can't figure out how to timestamp incoming texts, annoying.I'd not recommend this phone to others due to my issues with it. If the ringer worked, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but since it is a phone, and it is supposed to ring, it's kind of a pain in the neck.
