lease do not buy this phone. We encountered so many issues with the Intex Cloud Cube phone.Screen unlock always showed up camera even while swiping towards phone.Touch screen becomes unresponsive.Operating system simply hangs every few minutes even during call.Please don't throw away your money on this phone. We had a terrible user experience with this model and seller 'Staunch' doesn't respond to queries.
