OS in not at all stable. My phone reboots 2-3 times everyday. (Sometimes gets stuck in boot cycle and keep freezing/blank-screen upon every boot) It freezes while calls are going on (almost 20-30% of time) and then there is no other option but to reboot. - This is the biggest drawback, phones are supposedly made to make/receive calls but this one lacks big time. Battery life is okay.
