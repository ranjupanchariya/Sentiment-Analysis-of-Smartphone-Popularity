The phone built quality and hardware is unbeatable. But the software lets you down in all aspects. You won't be able to do anything other than making calls, mails and documents editing. No watsapp, facebook, google maps etc., None of the basic apps are available. Moreover blackberry is going to stop support. I bought this phone on Feb 2016 and sold it now as I was not able to do anything with that phone.
