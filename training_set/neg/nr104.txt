I will just mention the cons, based on that you can decide if you want to go for this phone. I bought it from Flipkart and used it for 4 days after selling it off to someone else because flipkart wouldn't accept a return or exchange.
1. The rear camera is suppose to be 13MP but does not stand up to the quality. Feels like 5MP or so. The front camera, even though just 2MP, is better than the rear.2. Battery life was just ok. Had to charge each day.3. The worst part was sound quality. It was too low, I couldn't hear properly during calls, I had to put it on loud speaker. Me and my friends tested it out various times through different service providers, still the fault was noticeable.Thats about it. I didn't face any other issues but I just had it for 4 days. My friend who bought it reported that the phone hangs quite frequently and there's nothing you can do about it because you cannot eject the battery or restart it. You have to let the battery drain so that yo can restart it.I would definitely not recommend this phone to anyone.
