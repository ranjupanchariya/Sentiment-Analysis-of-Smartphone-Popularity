Htc has worst after sales service in India. I bought a htc and it had network fluctuation issue since the day i bought it and i handed over my handset to the htc authorised service center twice for this problem and they kept the handset for about a month with them for repair but this issue has still not been solved. The handset still has the same problem. And u won't even find the number of any service head of htc on their website.
