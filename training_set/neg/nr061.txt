Bought this phone 10 days back but after use this phone has disappointed me..Lava claim of never let's you down is fake.... This phone is not serving even for 12 hours...I purchased this phone as it's Indian make but totally blocked my money as this phone is not serving is basic feature..3gb ram is also of no use as when apps are running then you feel phone performance not upto mark....Camera is OK but in that also when we send some video to someone thru watsapp then it's getting corrupted..Feeling fooled by Lava, ms Dhoni & Kapil Sharma should stop endorsing this brand...If any Lava concerned reads this article, would request you to rectify these asap for new customers...
Advise to other buyers, don't go with this model if you expect reliability from Lava..
