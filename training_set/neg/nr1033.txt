I bought this phone though many friends advised against buying such an expensive phone from Flipkart. I thought its available from flipkarts own biggest retailer and protected with 30 day guarantee so went ahead and bought this. When i got the phone the box was like years old used phone. I thought may be its because of staying in warehouse for long and it is inside what matters. Phone looked quite new I must say nice work in Refurbishing and old peace of crap to sell as new. The phone started playing up and not working up to the mark at all. When talked to them. The WS retailer rejected my complain without even taking anything into consideration. So please people dont ever buy things online just to save few Bucks as these people are the biggest Fraud who will suck your Money and dream to use a nice phone.
