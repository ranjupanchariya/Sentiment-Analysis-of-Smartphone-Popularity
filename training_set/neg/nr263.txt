this is the worst phone i ever buy. i bought REDMI NOTE 4G three months before. it was going good for some days. then after few days some small problems starts occurring in it. such as :1. firstly its front camera was bluring pics from one side.2. then its power on/off button stops working.3. & few days before its screen starts blinking.4. & from last week its stops working.it was not being power on. & when i go to the customer care center. they said,"its mother board & display was not working & they will not REPAIR it in warranty. they are asking me to pay them Rs8000-9000 for repair. which is the cost for new phone. so why will i pay them this huge amount. if they cannot even resolve my problems .i can buy new phone of any other brand & they will surely give 100% warranty for a year. i suggest to all not to buy this phone or any redmi phone ever.....
