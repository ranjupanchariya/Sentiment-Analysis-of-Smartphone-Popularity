I bought the phone in February 2015. I did not have any issues with the phone till October 2015. Suddenly the vibrator stopped working. After visiting the "authorized service station" on 28th November 2015 they said it would take 1 week for the issue to be resolved. They needed to replace the motherboard and had ordered for a replacement part. Even today the "authorized service station" has no idea when the hardware would be delivered and are helpless. The Motorola call center is also not very responsive and are really pathetic at their work. It is now around 1 month my phone is lying in the service station and still the Motorola call centers have no clue about the delivery status of the motherboard to their authorized service station. The call center escalated this issue to the next level and informed i would receive a call from their concerned person in 48 hours. Eventually the person who was handling this escalated request called up after 15 days and still he had no precise answer as to when the shipment would actually reach the "authorized service station". The problem I see is that the parent company (Motorola) too is confused and has no knowledge of their products and part shipments. According to the people working at the "authorized service station" Motorola is not prompt with the spare part shipments. Lack of presence of service stations and complete mismanagement on behalf of Motorola generally makes life of users miserable. I have called up the service station multiple times in the past 4 weeks and as usual every time a new person answers the call and every time you need to repeat the issue you are facing. This becomes time consuming and irritating. I am very disappointed I bought this product. If you want better service please consider other options. I would not suggest anyone to buy any Motorola phones. Please consider other options. A big NO-NO from my side for Motorola Phones. I am adding to the review. Today it has been over 1 month and Motorola is least bothered about when they would returning my phone from the service center. Motorola there is no single point of contact which is worst. As everytime you call you need to explain everything all over again. There is no clear answer. I am fed up with the Motorola service. There is no escalation contact point and call centers have no authority for escalation. With this review I am hoping I can stop atleast 1 person from buying this phone with utterly crappy and useless service. I definitely will never buy a motorola phone ever again.
