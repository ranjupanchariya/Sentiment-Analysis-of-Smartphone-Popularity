his phone is cheap.  I got it for my husband because he needed a new phone, and he did not like it.  It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.  Plus it does not let you change the background color.  Only black.  Boring.  You can change the box colors, but my husband wanted wallpapers, which it does not do.  He did not like the setup and we ended up sending it back.
