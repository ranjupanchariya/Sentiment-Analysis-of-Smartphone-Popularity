Never expected this from samsung. I have updated my mobile from GB to ICS 4.0.3 from then whenever I enable WiFi device will reboot. This happens each and every time you enable WiFi. Also enabling 5.1 channel in music playback is causing breaks in the playback. How come samsung don't perform any basic testing on the phone before releasing the update. GB was stable and good. They don't really care about customer they have and go for new customers with new releases and leave the old products.
