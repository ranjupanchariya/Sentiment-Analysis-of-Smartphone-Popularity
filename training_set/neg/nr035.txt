If this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best, but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.The email feature is very good, although it only checks for email from most ISP servers every 15 minutes, and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience. To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo, which means you will get copies of your email immediately. However, if you want to reply, you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider. You'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call, the screen goes dark quickly, and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance. The default \"Sure Type\" mode that suggests words is cumbersome, and changing its suggestions can be maddening. Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard, an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance. And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back; it's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials don't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone's features; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it's supposed to. After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff, I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time, which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems, all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as \"known issues\" and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade (think Windows Vista):* Voice-command dialing (e.g., via Bluetooth headset) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots (a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds, replacing it, and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again).* The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger; it may require one or more reboots to start charging.* Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem; the fix will last a couple of days, before the problem recurs.* The network connection turns itself off occasionally, and you won't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups, I purchased aBlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset, which the manual recommends. It has cut down on, but not eliminated, the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me \"wipe\" the phone and start over (choose the \"Options\" button, then \"Security Options,\" then \"General Settings,\" then press the menu button and choose \"Wipe Handheld\"; all the software reloads automatically, but you will have to reload any personal data). That helped with most of the problems, including the Outlook synch problem, which hasn't recurred (it's been 10 days).
