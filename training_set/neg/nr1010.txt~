Pl dont take this product, i had a small audio Jack problem and the Motorola customer care people have told me that they dont have the spare and its been almost 3 months now still no idea when vl i get my phone.so pl if u dont want to have such nightmares just avoid buying Motorola phones that's it. And I have filed a legal case against them in consumer forum still they are not serious.
