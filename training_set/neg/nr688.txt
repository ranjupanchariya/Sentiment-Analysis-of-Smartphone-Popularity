Takes too much time to start up.....its been only few days i bought this phone ...and it is getting hanged up and showing difficulty in starting up.Its better to invest in a good quality phone even if the price is more. Trying to save money by buying phones of this kinds of brands....proves to be a loss in the long run. I regret it
