My firend got this phone on the Big Bullion Day. He was in a bit of a hurry and did not want to buy Moto G 2nd Gen because he didn't like it's looks. Anyway he told me about this I found that it was actually HTC's Moto E for double the price of Motorola's! I mean a Snapdragon 200 processor at 12k? Plus after receiving the phone, the biggest disappointment which I had least expected turned out to be the camera. A 5MP fixed focus camera is the worst ever I have ever seen. The front 2MP camera is poorer than even the VGA camera of the Zenfone! And it still runs the 4.2.2 jellybean android with zero scope of any upgrade. The back is excessively prone to fingerprints and scratches. Worst phone at this price.
