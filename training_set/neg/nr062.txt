Finally regulating rating.. after 10-12 days of time wasting I realise about not to buying fraud company mobiles and beware of untrustworthy sellers.....Though VERY happy with flipkart's replacement/ refund policy...it saved my money...but now I won't buy lava phones...they really use cheap material for mobiles ..
