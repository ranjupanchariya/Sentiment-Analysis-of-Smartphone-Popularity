I bought the phone 3 months back. The display has gone bad. They have the service center only at Banglaore. They have pikup centers across India.All the phones are dispatched for repair to Bangalore. Hence there shall be a considerable delay before the diagnosis is done phone repaired and dispatched back to its home location. Would never recommend any one to buy an HTC phone. The service center executive has asked me to call after a week to enquire the status of my phone, rather than given me timely updates
