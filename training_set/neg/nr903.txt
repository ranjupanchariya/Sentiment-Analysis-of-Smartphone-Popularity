I m using this phone for over a month now. About the phone, i dont think it delivers to the expectation one gets after seeing so many good reviews on various websites and TV programmes. I am facing following issues. Poor reception of Wifi network. I have to move around the house to get atleast decent reception. I also own HTC incredible S which is far far far better than S 2 when it comes to Wifi reception. Overheating of phone when you browse internet. Poor Battery. I have to charge atleast twice a day. When you start any media (songs or video) to hear, the media volume is always 0, when you try to increase it.It does not increase until you restart it. WTF So give a second thought before buying S2.
