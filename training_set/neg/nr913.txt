Hi friends,I was very happy with my Nexus 5, as I thought Nexus 6 would be better than Nexus5, have bought Nexus 6 in January 2015 from flipkart, Very slow and very large phone, , I was not happy with my decision, As the camera stopped working from 06-12-2015 I have given the mobile to B2X Motorola service Center, Visakhapatnam on 12-12-2015 as it was under warranty, So far they have not received the camera according to them as they need to replace that part, Even after spending Rs.44,000 I am totally unhappy, with quality of the product and worst service, I made up my mind that I will never buy a Motorola in my lifetime. With this experience you may decide to buy a motorola de
