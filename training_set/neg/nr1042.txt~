The worst online shopping experienced till date. I bought nexus 6 from my another account on 8th feb, 2015 and after just 2-3 days it had a minor fall from a height not more than 2 to 2.5 feet n the screen broke to an extent dat the phone is in a unusable condition. I contacted both motorola service centre n flipkart customer care and they say they both r not liable for my loss, I bought the phone from my 5 months salary and the motorala service centre said the screen would cost me atleast 30,000 inr. The phone itself is costing 49,000 and now they say i have to shed at least 30,000 to fix it after just using it for 2 days. And the kind of service flipkart gave is way below poor. I dont know if it was poor assembling or something else but a minor 2 feet fall just broke it completely. In my opinion its better to buy phones from retail outlets rather than ordering online n getting a bad product n getting a poor after sales service. The flipkart didn't do anything to help me in this situation n even motoral service centre official said i might have to wait cux the parts of nexus 6 r still not available in India.
