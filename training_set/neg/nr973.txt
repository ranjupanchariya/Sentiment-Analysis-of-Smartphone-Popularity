I ordered nexus 6 on 27th Jan and got it on 2nd Feb. It had a much heating issue. Complained flipkart for it and got a new phone on 6th Feb. It was a horrible experience from WS Retailer as i openedd the sealed box it had scratches and dust on the cell phone. Also its back panel was peeling off from back side. Again contacted Flipkart but this time they are not replacing but refunding me. It is sad to say i liked the handset but cannot get a replacement for 2nd time. and now fear to order it again as the incidence might not happen again.
