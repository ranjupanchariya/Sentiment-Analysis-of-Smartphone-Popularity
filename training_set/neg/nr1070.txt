I would like to thank flipkart as it taught me an important lesson in life that i should never purchase anything from flipkart,Nexus 6 is awesome but flipkart made it buggy . Its not flipkart its fraudkart. Mobile was not in good condition when it was delivered .they promised to give me 10% discount if ordered through sbi debit card but those frauds didnt gave any discount . Before placing an order i even confirmed about the discount .When i complained about the same they said that my complaint has been registered and they will reply me after 4 working days . After 4 days flipkart removed the offer of 10% discount and i got a mail that you cannot recieve the cashback as there was no offer about it on that date. Fortunately i had removed the screenshot of the offer on that date and so i sent the screenshot of the offer and details ( time and date of screenshot taken) I can even produce the same to yourl ( just mail me at manishshrof@gmail.com and i will show the same to yourl ) . Even after sending the screenshot to flipkart they say that there is no screenshot recieved . Every time i had to call i had to repeat the same story every person was giving some other excuse . I am very disgusted how can flipkart fall so much for 2500 rs . Till now i didnt recieve the cashback . Plz never buy anything from flipkart
