I bought this phone a month back and now it is in service centre since last 15 days.After 15 days of purchase it went dead. when I visited service centre they told me that it has got battery issue and they will replace the battery. However since its a new lava model battery is not available and it will take some time.Yesterday I received a call saying my phone is ready when I visited service centre they told me that it has got issue with Motherboard which also needs to be replaced and since its a new model it will take a week more to get it replaced.I used this phone just for 12 days and waiting for it to get repaired since more than 15 days now.
