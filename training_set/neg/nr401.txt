Had this phone for over 3 weeks but just had to return it. Let me tell you this phone has a great quality build and great spec's. The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a \"point and shoot\" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your \"point and shoot\" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase. But if your out looking for a great overall Smartphone then I recommend you look away from anything running Symbian
