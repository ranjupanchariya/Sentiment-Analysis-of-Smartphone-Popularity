Hi I got this mobile with so much of hope for camera. But after unpacking it at night in my room , some dark strips were coming in the camera GUI which were moving from right to left. It is sever when you are pointing to the direction of light. Even in captured photos these bands are visible. Other things like night mode or setting shutter speed manually fix the issue up to an extent. Most probably this is due to software issue.
