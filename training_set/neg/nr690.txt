I got this phone around eight to nine months ago, expecting it to be a good one. I had never bought any Asus phone so gave it a try. The phone seemed a bit overpriced as quite a number of new brands were giving 3GB of RAM within 10k. But this gave only 2GB, still got it because it gave a mammoth 5000mAh of battery. It was a bit slow considering that the phone has been tweaked to compromise performance for a greater battery life.The worst part about the phone is its screen.it mentioned that the buyer gets the Gorilla Glass 3. The thing is whatever they give is absolute shit and even if you drop the phone from 2ft above the ground, it surely will break the screen. It fell around three times from my hand and the screen looked horrible as the screen was already broken into a hundred small pieces. I don't use the phone now as the charging port got damaged. I went to the service centre and they told me that my warranty is void due to external damage. What I feel is that this is ASUS policy to give screen which is easily breakable so that virtually everyone will break the screen and the company can make further profits as the screen breakage will mean that the warranty will get void.You should never buy this phone as it is the worst ever experience I had in my life. I wouldn't recommend my friends and family to buy this piece of shit. I would rather stop them even if they are hell bent to buy one and also would urge people not buy this.
