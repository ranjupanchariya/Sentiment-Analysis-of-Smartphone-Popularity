This phone is awful! For starters, activation alone is enough to almost make you want to return the phone. I never had to google how to activate a phone until I got this one. This was the most difficult non-smart phone I have ever encountered.To top it off, the app store would not work once I finally got the bloody thing activated! I had to google how to fix that too. You shouldn't have to go through all of this for a &#34;simple&#34; phone that runs Web OS. The poor app selection is fine with me since I mainly needed a phone with a physical qwerty keyboard for texting. I can also sync my email to it, so that is a plus. It is safe to say that if I dropped this phone or it breaks, I will NOT buy another one of these!
