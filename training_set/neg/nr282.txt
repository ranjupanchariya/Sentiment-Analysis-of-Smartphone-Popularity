It is a very bad product of a good company, it is very disappoint me when i use this after redmi 1, because some features which is available in redmi 1 they are not in 2, like if i want a wallpaper set in central of screen which i cant do, some user friendly feature like redmi 1 is not in 2, we can set home screen, wallpaper, launcher setting and some more in redmi 1s from menu button but this features are not in redmi 2. Vibration & Volume is very poor like redmi 1 which is very negative for the phone. In redmi 2 i cant hear voice of caller when i do some work and i put it between my ear and shoulder, redmi 2 is heating on long call and on charging time.
