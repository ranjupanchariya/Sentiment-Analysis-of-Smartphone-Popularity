Worst product till date by Motorola and Google. Crashed so many times, I stopped keeping count after a while. Randomly would shutdown. Upgrading to 5.1.1 made the basic functions like phone, contacts stop working. Every time I would make a call, it will go dark (no option than to reboot which takes another eternity to bring the phone back up). Even with that, first reboot would not work and then would keep spinning for restarting all the apps which would take another 5-10 minutes. Overall a real shitty product by Google and Motorola and surprisingly they are selling this as premium/ cutting edge/loaded with all latest hardware type of product. I had to take heavy losses in selling it and had to return to familiar Samsung land.Purchasing online poses another challenge in selling it in local markets. I generally don't review and bash any technology like this but this time I really felt cheated...Actually don't want to give even one star...
