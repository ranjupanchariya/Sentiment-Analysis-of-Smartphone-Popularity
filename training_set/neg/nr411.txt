Seller sent me faulty piece, its like it is already used mobile and returned to seller after using and they sent me same piece which was used.Mobile don't ring only most of the time, i have to restart the mobile every time to start media and notification volume.Don't know its blackberry's software problem or sellers defective product.Ya and even the space button is also seems to be used first, as it is over pressed and feel like fully operational like other keypad keys.
