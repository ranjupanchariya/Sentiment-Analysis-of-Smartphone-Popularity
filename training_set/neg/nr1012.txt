I received the Nexus 6 by yesterday morning (14th January 2016). It was a 2015 January imported phone and the outer box itself seems dirty. When i switched on the device and connected to WiFi, they asked some permissions to update the OS from android 5.0. As soon as the phone started updating, it showed some error and started rebooting and shows optimizing apps. then after optimizing its started rebooting again and started optimizing apps and this rebooting optimizing process is happening continuously. I requested FlipKart for a replacement of the phone through its return policy. Hoping the best from FlipKart team.
