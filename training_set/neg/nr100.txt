One of the worst phones ever manufactured. It was all rosy and shiny in the beginning, but after 3-4 months of usage it showed its infamy of belonging to MICROMAX. At first it started lagging and then the usual wear and tear of phone slowing up. The worst problem of this phone has to be the battery. The battery drains even when not in use. Try it to believe it. I charge the phone to its full and keep it unused for an hour and the battery comes down to 85 from 100. This can happen only with Micromax.NEVER buy this PHONE or to be on the safer side any phone from Micromax.
