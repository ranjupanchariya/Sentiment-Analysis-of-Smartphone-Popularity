Overall product is ok but not the best. this time Lenovo really make fool to Indian people by saying that they use Snapdragon 616 processor 1.7 Ghz octa core The processor was a Qualcomm Snapdragon but was disappointed to find 1.5 GHz Processor instead of 1.7GHz as mentioned here, also you get 1.8Gb of RAM instead of 2Gb.asks you to choose your default 4G/3G SIM after which the other SIM automatically gets assigned to 2G network which is very annoying
