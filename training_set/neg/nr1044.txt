Please note that I am not at all happy with the service that you are providing to deliver my mentioned Order (OD201720326035465600), for a reason I ordered it next day delivery, Delivery date was Tuesday 6th Jan and I was willing to pay an extra Rs 90 charge, order was delayed because I mentioned that I will be in Office from 9AM- 6PM and deliver the package to my address after 6PM, for which Delivery guys response was that they do not work during that time and service until 9PM is only for Metro cities, my question is are we paying less for your services? Why you have specifically mentioned on your message that the package will be delivered to you before 9PM ? remove that if not applicable for all cities, Secondly, next day on phone the guy told us that he will deliver the package in my Office address but he has left his office and forgot to pick up the Debit/Credit card swiping machine for which he told that he will take time as he has to go back to the office and get it, was it my mistake, is it customers responsibility to remind him to pick it up? and I am not sure but I think he went out of station after the call? because Ive not heard from him since that time.. Its 8th Jan today, we are already running late.. Please note that I am angry and will now not be paying Extra Rs 90 for this delivery. As no efforts were made from your side to deliver the package to me on time.
