I TOOK THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART PRE-ORDER IN DECEMBER END 2014. I USED NEARLY 6 MONTHS AND I WAS SATISFIED. MY PHONE JUST FELL FROM 2 FEET HEIGHT DUE TO SOME IMBALANCE AND THE ENTIRE SCREEN IS GONE ALONG WITH THE DISPLAY. I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPEN TO ANY OTHER PHONE IN THE SAME CASE. THE COST IS NEARLY 23000 WHICH I AM SHOCKED TO HEAR. ALL SMART PHONES HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL DISPLAY AND SCREE IN THE RANGE OF 5000-8000. I WOULD REQUEST YOU ALL NOT TO GO WITH THIS PHONE AND THINK SOME OTHER OPTION.
