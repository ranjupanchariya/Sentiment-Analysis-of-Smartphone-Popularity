I was one of those that tried to purchase on launch day, but had to order and received it bout 5 days later.  This is my first time owning a Blackberry and purchased it for $100, including rebates and plus I was an existing customer.  I was pretty disappointed with this phone, but ended keeping any ways.  I had a LG Voyager and loved it and waiting for the new one to come out and I will jump ship as soon as the new one comes out.  I updated the new software but still the same.  All I can Say is even though all the experts are saying the Iphone is better.  I will never ever buy anything from Apple, cause I just think their products are garbage.  I still can't believe the new 3G Iphone still does not support music streaming and the Itunes software is trash.  Well enough bout my babbling on the piece of crap Apple products. I just hope RIM fixes all the bugs or they'll lose many customers.
