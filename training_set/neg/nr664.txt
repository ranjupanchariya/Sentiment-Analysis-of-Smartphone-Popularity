I have purchased this phone for my mother and it costed me 15000/-being a HTC fan, i preffered this expecting with good features, As its HTC the OS is really smooth and friendly, but only operating is not all right.This 516 Has 4 GB inbuilt in which atleast 3gb is not user available which is not at all worth,RARE CAMERA is very very Poor, and front cam is better in featured phones,Pixels are worst and i cannot find other words..After using this phone i never want to go for HTC again :(Please do not buy this phone
