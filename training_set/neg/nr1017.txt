I ordered this phone on 15th of October, and till now i.e 22 nd October it had not been shipped . customer care says you will get it 30th of October. The issue is if i order now, i will get it by 27th October , within five day. And the matter of fact is that the seller is also same W.S Retail. . Moreover i call customer care to get the status of my product, they disconnect the call. Worst Service support Flipkart.
