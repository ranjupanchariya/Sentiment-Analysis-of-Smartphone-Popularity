I bought a Micromax Canvas Turbo A 250 through Flipkart on 10.02.2013 and contrary to some of the reviews about the product, I was pretty disappointed. The battery i.e. 2000 maH is totally inadequate for the features of the this phone and lasts only for 4 to 5 hours. I am not in the habit of playing games or using the camera often. While the phone per se is functioning alright, I had to return the phone to a service center in Chennai who has been keeping the phone over the last one week promising a battery replacement. I have no hope of any improvement in the functioning of the phone as they are going to replace the existing battery with the same 2000 mAH battery.It is better to buy variants of recognised brands rather than going in for these value for money propositions
