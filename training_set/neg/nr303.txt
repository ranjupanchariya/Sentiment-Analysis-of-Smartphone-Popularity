This phone whold be perfect if the keyboard letters was a bit wider when the phone is in portraits mode. Almost every word I type. Is incorrect. Forget about getting a email or a text written quick because your gonna need to go back and correct the spelling of every other  word. And my fingers are. Skinny.i hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing. Also when browsing internet you can back up a page but after you back up you can't go forward. How dumb.and forget about laying down on the bed and type. The screen will constantly be rotating with every move you make. Rotation. Can't even lock on this phone. The still didn't release a update. Its no camera flash either. I guess that's it. If these few but major things could be improved this phone would be a winner. big improvements needed. Look up at the top where I spelled \"would \" wrong. I actually had to go through this whole paragraph correcting mid spelled words because the keyboard sucks. The phone won't even allow me to select it and fix it. I fixed all the other errors. Who it act like it can select that word.and the last sentence \"who\" should be \"why\" but its not legging me correct it. Oh well. I'm done in not gonna spend another minute correcting errors. If I was typing from mh iPhone 4s I would have been finished writing this review with no errors. A half hour passed already
