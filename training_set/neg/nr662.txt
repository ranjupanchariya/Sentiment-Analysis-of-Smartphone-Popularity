We got the HTC 816G delivered on 19th jan and when we opened the box we saw that the charger along with the phone was a used one with scratches in it. The phone would not get switched on and neither would it get charged. We tried charging it with the other HTC charger we had ( since we already have 2 other HTC phones at home) but the phone wouldnt work. Extremely disappointed with the vendor and flipkart to send such a defective piece. We have asked for a refund
