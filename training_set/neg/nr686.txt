i received asus max phone, it is not good and please don't buy, previously i was using zenphone 5 it has 5MPcamera, actually that was good, in this max model they are saying 13MP not at all that much clarity, pics are coming very badly, i was expected 13MP means it'll be good, don't buy if still your orders on the way cancel orders immediately.pics are coming like in Lennova A6000+, waste phone, and one more thing sound in ear phones, nothing output coming, we can't enjoy music in this. stop buying if you buy you'll be regret. thanku.
