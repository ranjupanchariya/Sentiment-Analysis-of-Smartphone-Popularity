What were they thinking??Nice Phone, but ONLY 500MB available on phone for Applications (NOT 4GB).The internal drive is factory partitioned to only allow 500MB for apps!(Other BLU phones in this price range that I have encountered usually have at least 1GB available).This is a paltry amount of available memory for an android phone. I only realized it on the phone when I ran out of space to install apps the first day I had it, and then called BLU support, who verified it, because it was hard to believe. Not half as much as other similar BLU phones I have encountered. Amazing because it has very few Bloatware factory unremovable apps on board.Apparently BLU engineering designated other RAM memory just for photos and the like.  Why would the do this?  Couldn't get my all my needs apps to fit!!!Other BLU phone in this price range have at least 1.0GB available - and that is also paltry, but manageable for many people for whom I set these phones up.There are  definitely other Blu phones with more memory available and on paper the specs look the same, but again:The ONLY to find out before you buy it seems to be to call BLU Support first. They admit that these are unpublished specs
