I bought this phone before 4 months. Phone design and performance is really great but HTC didn't provide the good hardware on this phone. I have visited 3 times in HTC service center due to phone software hung issue and MIC issue. Phone's front second speaker strip removed automatically which was really unacceptable. After resolve the MIC problem still some times I face MIC issue while I call to anyone. I really disappointed for this type of hardware by which I got trouble multiple times
