On a different note we generally do not tend to believe in a review. From my heart as a harassed user I'm writing this.The phone if not even worth a price, if in any situation I'm granted this as a complimentary gift, I would be glad to refuse it.Worthless battery, low quality display, extremely stupid and arrogant service centres that take 30 days to just format the phone.I personally am writing this just to advise everyone not to buy this phone.I repeat don't.
