I've had the HTC Hero for almost a year and can honestly say that this is the worst cell phone I have ever had the displeasure of owning. There are so many bugs and glitches in this thing that it's better suited as a paperweight. Yes, I have done all the updates and am using the app killer and it's still junk. My 2 major gripes are battery life and lag. PLEASE, before buying this phone, do an internet search and check out the numerous sites that are dedicated to this piece of junk phone.**UPDATE**I am still under my 2 year contract with this phone (2 months to go) and it's still a collosal piece of junk. Absolutely the worst phone I have ever had. I can't saying anything good about this phone. I think HTC should refund everyone who bought this phone, seriously. HTC knowingly put out a phone that they knew was a complete piece of junk! Anyway, do not buy this phone!
