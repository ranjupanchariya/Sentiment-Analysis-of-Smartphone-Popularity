I bought Lava Pixel V2 3/4 days back. Phone is good overall but battery sucks. with 100% charge and very normal usage like browsing 15 mins, talk 15 mins, what's app 20 mins and idle remaining time, i ran out of battery. I consistently monitored usage against battery consumption but same results all the time. With full charge it does not even last for 8 hours. Consider this drawback if you want to buy it.Thanks.
