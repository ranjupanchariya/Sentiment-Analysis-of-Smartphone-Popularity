Hi There, This Product (HTC Dsire 816G) worked good for some decent amount of time after post purchase. But when I made an attempt to switch off and switch it on back, there started a problem for me. Phone just juggled in start brand page (HTC). It vibrated and played music in some regular intervals but phone was not landed to home screen. I got worried a lot because, I cannot use my nano sims in any other phone for my use. Then I restarted in safe mode using hold on lower volume button and power button. Then phone landed to home screen we display as 'Safe Mode' in bottom left end. All my, self installed got erased. I advise users to test switch off and on once you receive the consignment. FlipKart, please be careful whicle choosing your sellers.
