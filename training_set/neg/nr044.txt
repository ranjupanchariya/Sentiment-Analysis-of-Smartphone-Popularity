I've now owned the phone for 90 days and I'm fighting with AT&T; to try and return it.  Its too much form over function and I can not longer handle the locks ups, battery running out in less than 8 hours, call hang ups (due to phone not AT&T;), trying to connect to internet but cannot until I reboot, etc.  Honestly I don't know how much is the fault of the phone or Window's mobile but I can't take it anymore.  If you want to look cool and have a cool phone go for it but if you want a functioning phone and PDA look elsewhere.  Unfortunately I cannot change my rating but I would rate is 2 stars if I could.----------------------------------I bought the ATT/HTC Fuze about 45 days ago.  It is truly a love/hate relationship but in the end I rated it 4 stars. Here are the pros/cons to help you with your understanding.Pros:- Touch Screen is cool- Micro SD card slot (up to 32GB card) for storage of songs- slide out qwerty keyboard for easier texting that touch screen and I do like the numbers being organized as a number pad with symbols above- good call quality- good apps (web access, google maps, weather)- syncs with web email accounts (comcast in my case) as well as corporate exchange servers with the ability to look up any contact from the exchange server- lots of apps and tweaks available for download- world capable phoneCons:- phone freezes about once every 3 days, requires reboot which only take about 30 seconds.- battery life is bad (must recharge at least each day based on 3 hours of phone use, syncing every 15 minutes).  My biggest issue with the phone.- bluetooth quirky - can't turn on bluetooth after phone rings and connect via bluetooth- can hang up phone call via touch screen accidentally which happens alot- phone is heavyNo Big Deal:- people will comment on the finger prints but a quick wipe on the shirt and they are goneHope this helps.
