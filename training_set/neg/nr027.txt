I got this phone from a friend because my Samsung Rant died on me. It's not a bad phone, I like the fact that you can use Wi-Fi, certain apps, and it's like Windows on your computer. The downside is the battery power on it is horrible, I have to charge it twice a day. Also, it freezes on me a lot so I constantly have to take the battery out to restart it. Sometimes it sends old text messages randomly to people so it's kind of odd. I'm glad I got it for free because I'd be upset if I spent money on this low grade Blackberry.
