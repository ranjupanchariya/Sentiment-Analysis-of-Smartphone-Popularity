I bought this phone to use for work. The BB10 OS is really nice, I like it better than the IOS 6.... but obviously the Apple eco system is much more useful, in all that it enables you to do.I knew the choice of apps would be limited for BB10, and I was ok with it (as I just wanted the phone to make calls and email, with BIG battery life)). However, to my surprise I found the most basic of apps missing- like for example there is no call blocking app for Q5 in the Blackberry world.... and in this age where a DTH service provider I used to use two years back, still harasses me to buy their service again with monthly calls we all badly need at least basic apps like this. Even the SMS blocker app for which I paid INR 150 is not as good as what I used to have on an Android phone.Some of the apps like the Pass Wallet. Zomato are optimized for Z10, so they don't allow for the smaller screen on the Q5- and you can't scroll down comfortably.There is an issue with Google 2 factor authentication, and I still have not managed to set up my Gmail account on this phone.So, it is a good phone- but beware of these limitations before you buy.
