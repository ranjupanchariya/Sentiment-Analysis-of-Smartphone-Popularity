Don't buy this ..its refabricated quality product at 19999 . nexus 6 has been officially discontinued in December 2015 and the product i got was having February 2016 manufacturing date written on it. Camera was really bad even a 8000 rs phone can click better pictures , may be this can be device specific problem. Screen has yellowish tint on it and yes it heats a lot. I have requested for refund.
