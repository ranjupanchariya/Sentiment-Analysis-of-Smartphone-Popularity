From the time I opened the box, this device never ever worked properly. It kept freezing at the welcome screen. Tried restarting it several times but in vain. Got really angry and frustrated with this mobile. I should had gone for Moto G instead of this pathetic device. Micromax should be sued for distributing such defective devices in the market and cheating people. My sincere request to all buyers, "DON'T EVER BUY ANY MICROMAX PRODUCT". I got cheated because the configuration of this mobile sounded so good and the price was also good, but all i got is this defective piece which is of no use. I am now fighting hard to get this mobile replaced, hope i atleast get a working piece. I request FLIPKART not to sell such defective products from such companies.
