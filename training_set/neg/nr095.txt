Don't let the sudden drops in its price tempt you to buy it !!Battery is obviously worst. Have to charge it again in less than 20 hours. As many people have pointed out, this device has serious display-related issues. Screen would go blank just after ending the call, although touch was still working and LED was still blinking. I could only answer the calls based on guess-based swiping, nothing else could I do. As battery is non-removable, you need to wait till battery drains out to restart the mobile and get back the display. Search for "Sachin Dhoot" on YouTube and you can see my uploaded video of the issue. The replacement piece received from FlipKart too had the same issue. Returned to FlipKart and obtained FULL REFUND.
