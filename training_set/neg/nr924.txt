This mobile doesnt offer nothing new .. and the price tag is quite for this configuration ..better to go for oneplus one or redmi note ... I thought the differentiating factor would be battery life .. but i was wrong ..one plus one lasts longer than this sucker nexus 6 .. Dont waste your money on this .. Lollipop is not stable yet .. hence i am experience more OS issues .. and sometimes observing very slow response while opening native applications like dialer,camera etc... Overall ..it is a very big disappointment for me in choosing nexus 6 .. I could not answer the call quickly while on drive Could not do SMS and open whatsapp quickly the only pro's about this device is camera quality and qhd are absolutely good ..
