I ordered Nexus 6 on 15th october and got on 24th october but from 25th the problem started. I tried to update on 1st day,2nd day , 3rd day,4th day but every day it did not got updated to 5.1.1 and was showing 5.0 and says already updated. I laughed because 6.0 marshmallow has been released 1 month ago and this piece still on android 5.0.  The next problem was all the apps...ie the ones i downloaded or the preinstalled app like gmail ....all used to run for max 5 mins and then it would shutdown automatically and return to main screen including the flipkart app. The biggest cheat was by flipkart that i ordered on 15th october but they gave me a piece manufactured and imported on jan 2015. If u buy any electronics including mobile from offline or other online store u wil get the latest stock ie imported in october or sept 2015 but flipkart gives u stock of jan 2015....real cheating. The benefit of new stock is that the problems in old stocks are solved in new stocks and also i confirmed from motorola customer care that if u purchase in october, you should have got android 5.1.1 preinstalled. All the above were manufacturing defects and i did factory reset twice but problem not solved. Now drawback in nexus 6 is its battery. It gets extremely heated during charging that you cannot touch it. another drawback was not able to transfer any files via bluetooth to any device. Only motorola engineers who made it can transfer i think.
