i bought nexus 6 last year on 31th dec, a month after it started sound problem afterwards i sent it for replacement but its problem never lasts,i have faced lots of issues on this phone .. namely: randomly restarting problem its happned many times and its so irritating; heating problem mainly when you charge phone; service availability (motorola, google) both never give you best advice; parts not easily available. after the outer glass broken i didnt find its outer glass i forcibly ordered glass from china. and finally its too handy, can't handle..overall,money worth not spending
