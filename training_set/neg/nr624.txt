Not at all satisfied. I have used Samsung s3 Lumia series , Moto g,g2, x play and now k5note. Its juat two days old and some time phones strucks or else touch is insensitive. Totally disappointed. Its better not to prefer this mobile only thing I liked is Dolby Atmos. Flipkart please buyback this mobile from me.i ll buy another mobile double the price of this
