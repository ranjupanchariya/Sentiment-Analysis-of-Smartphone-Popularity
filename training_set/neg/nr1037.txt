To begin with, I had been wanting to buy this phone for a long time and seeing the very good reviews on flipkart, I chose to buy it from here.Sadly, I got the phone replaced thrice. 1st time there were software related issues with the phone which did not get resolved even after a reset. Heating problem and call drops were there too. And there was some substantial amount of dust at the bottom of the box below accessories. 2nd time the package delivered was a tampered one so I did not even open it. 3rd time the volume rocker was quite wobbly and there were issues with the speaker and there was a layer of dust on the screen. This was an extremely disappointing shopping experience with flipkart. The seller WS Retail should get their Jan 2015 import batch checked since the faulty phones were from that batch. Online shopping experience at times does not give you that freedom to ask for the latest items in inventory. That does not give the seller right to sell defective or refurbished phones to unassuming customers! Lastly, inspite of having evolved into a marketplace, flipkart should put quality checks in place if they are to live up to their earlier standards.
