Too much bugs and issues with this bugship (we can say) phone. It is not only problem with me but many of the other ppl facing same issues. So many updates since its google but none of the update worth. My phone gets shutdown more than 4 times in a day. Don't know whom to contact and what to do. Really not worth investing 44k for this buggy phone. If you go for others reviews I don't mind, you can go ahead and buy this product. For me its pathetic phone. Not at all recommended. Phone gets heat up not even at first time but always.
