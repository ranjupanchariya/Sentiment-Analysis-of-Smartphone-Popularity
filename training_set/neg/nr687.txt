i have been using it for more than 3 months now but lately (last 1 month or more) i am experiencing serious connectivity issues. people are unable to reach me and likewise i am unable to call from my phone although i have 1-3 network bars which is such a big problem that i am thinking of replacing this phone with some other model. i have also reached out to ASUS and Airtel but, no solution yet. please suggest
