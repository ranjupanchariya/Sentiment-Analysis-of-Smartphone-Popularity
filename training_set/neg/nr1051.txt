While it was the flagship it made some sense, to some people who liked super wide screens and the native android. With the next versions coming in, this purchased is not justified. A screen replacement, will cost you ask much as the phone itself (at the current selling price). So, for those of us who like the clean and neat untampered android, its time to move to the next generation.
