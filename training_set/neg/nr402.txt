et. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it's the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can't recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it's better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that's really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you'll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won't since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it's a step backwards and the app store doesn't have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you'll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can't. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren't that many good ones. Try it for yourself though. Maybe you'll like it
