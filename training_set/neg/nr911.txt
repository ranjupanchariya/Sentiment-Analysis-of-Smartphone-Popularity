The phone powers off at 15% after it displays the message "powering off". The phone does power back on and works until the battery reaches 5% and powers off again, at this point it only powers back on if its connected to the power brick. I have tried resetting the phone and the bootloader logs trick but no joy. The phone is just about two weeks old. There are no signs of a bloated battery and also I have only used the supplied charger. I requested Flipkart for a replacement but the replacement phone wouldn't even display the powering off message, would power off at even 60% battery.
