Though i am a ASUS brand loyal customer. Worst experience ever in life.Display got damaged inside. Externally no damage. Don't know the reason.
Service people told that it can't be covered under warranty.Phone getting too much heat. not that much clarity in volume. No help.Totally Frustrated. (-100 star)
