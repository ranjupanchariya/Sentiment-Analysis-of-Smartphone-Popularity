Confused..and frustated..... I don't blame flipkart..but really confused: 1st i order lava v2 3gb on 27/10/16, received on 02/11/16, on receiving i found item was defective, just within 1 hour i processed for replacement. Flipkart approved it and they sent me replacement product lava v2 3gb. I just received the replacement mobile today 06/11/16 1.20 pm around. Immediately opened it as excitement and fear of "what it can be?? Fine or worst?" .
