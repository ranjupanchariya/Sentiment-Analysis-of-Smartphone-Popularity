Hardware (2 stars): Looks like Lenovo have compromised heavily on hardware configuration.a) Turns out that the processor is cheap - hence they are able to sell the phone at low cost.b) The touch screen went haywire after 2 months of use - screens moving rapidly; random apps being clicked; etc.c) Basically, the touch screen sensors were detecting touch from various random parts of the screen simultaneously and continuously; hence the erratic behavior.d) I ran some antivirus/malware detection apps and didn't find any viruses/malware. The service centre confirmed that this was a hardware issue and the touch panel needed to be replaced.Service (0 stars): Lenovo service is the lousiest I have come across!a) First of all, you'll have trouble finding an authorized Lenovo service centre for mobiles, because there are just one or two per city (note: the service centres for laptops and mobiles are different).b) Moreover, most service centres don't pick up calls ever (ref: Lenovo representative at Pimpri service centre).c) Lastly, they'll try their best to get the customer to pay for hardware again (they quoted Rs 3900 to change top panel including touchscreen), even if the phone is in warranty and is not damaged or tampered.
