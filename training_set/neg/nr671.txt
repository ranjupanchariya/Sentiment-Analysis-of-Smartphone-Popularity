I have bought this phone exactly a year ago. With in few weeks I have faced a display issue. but it was normal after few hours. So I have not paid any attention. But now it is completely gone.Service executive is saying it is an mother board issue. But the cost of mother board replacement is 7k. What a non sense. I suggest you do not buy these low cost phones from Karbon. It is just a use and through phone. Just remember this before you buy
