Nexus 6 is awsome mobile. Smooth in Performance. No Lags at all. Still after 5 months camera malfunctioned dont know how. Image Stabilizer of Camers started vibrating & started giving Blurr Pictures. As it is in warranty period i was not worried. But After Submitting to Service Centre actual Headc]ache started. Parts for Nexus 6 is not available in India, so it took almost 19 days for replacement of camera part. After replacement also it was not working properly again i have to submit it to a service centre. Customer Care show you as they care but actually they dont tommorow 18th june its going to be a month & still they have not updated date of delivery of my repaired mobile. So think what will happen after warranty. Think twice before you investing in this product.through my research Nexus6 if you buy from playstore it has different service provider i dont know how.
