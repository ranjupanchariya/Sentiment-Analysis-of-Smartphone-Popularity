When I opened box there were some light scratch at back of the mobile. I think scratch was due to bad packaging as mobile was laying inside box without any protection and back panel was rubbing with warranty paper. I can see scratch at warranty paper also, that could have done the scratch to back panel . or other possibility is it was used by any other buyer and he would have returned it after few days use.
