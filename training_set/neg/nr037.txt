here are good and bad things about the Blackberry Storm.  If you're reading this, chances are you've already researched this phone a bit and you've probably read other reviews.  Obvious comparisons are abound about the Storm vs. the iPhone.  The Storm is a well built phone, but the interface just doesn't compare.Pros:Organizing your life with the Storm is easy.  The calender, alarm, notes, and navigation are a little tough to learn at first, but are easily mastered.  If you have used a Blackberry before, you'll have no trouble picking this up and going on your way.  Hey, this is the main feature of a Blackberry...right?The build of the phone is nice and sturdy.  You don't have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket.Micro USB standard charger - this means a lot of your electronics will use the same charger.The internet is fast, if you can deal with the touch screen.Jim Halpert is featured on the commercials!  Big tuna.Cons:I've used the iPhone and the LG Dare, so I know touch screen phones.  The Storm is a nightmare to text on.The touch screen clicking takes a bit to get used to.  I didn't like it, although I'm sure some will.  When I highlight an application, I expect it to open...I don't expect to have to highlight something, THEN click it again.No built in internal memory - you'll need to pick up a micro SD card if you want to put videos or music on there.The screen isn't as impressive looking as either it's touch screen counterpart the iPhone or it's AT&T; brother, the Bold.The bottom line is - if you can get used to the touch screen, this will be a fine phone for you.  I didn't like the touch screen, so most of the features didn't do what I needed them to.  This phone is just too young - wait for the next version.
