It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone, but no driver for it.  The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone. Go through live Internet update to version 4.35, still no driver for it.  Tried Motorola web site, there is no driver download for this phone. Contacted Motorol support, they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone.  Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later, on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours, still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services, then sync the phonebook that way.  We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age, you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.  Not with Motorola.  I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola, so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver....
