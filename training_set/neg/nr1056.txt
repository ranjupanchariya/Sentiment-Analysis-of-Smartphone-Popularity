I bought this phone in June 2015 from Flipkart and I have never been more unhappy with any phone I have ever used before. The most basic function that a phone is supposed to do: call, does not work until you close all background apps, after which only it will be able to list contacts so that you can pick a contact to call. Same for SMS. I have not noticed this issue in any other phone, android or non-android but all of my friends who use Nexus 6 report this same issue. I will neither buy another Nexus nor Motorola phone again. I am not sure if this is a hardware or a software issue, but no other apps like facebook, whatsapp have this issue on the same phone, just the contacts in messenger/phone app.
