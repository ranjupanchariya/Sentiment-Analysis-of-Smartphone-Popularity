No Doubt it is supposed to be a Orsum phone with 2 Ghz processor but the double standards ( for unknown reasons) by ASUS has disappointed the Indian user. I bought this phone after reading about the specifications @ www.asus.com A 5 inch display was OK for me but i preferred a 2 Ghz processor. But after buying the phone checked the processor with CPU-Z and was shocked to find a 1.6 Ghz processor. Have written to ASUS about this but dont hope that I will get a solution. Lenovo K900 was a better option
