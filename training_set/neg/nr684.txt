Used the phone for 5-6 days and returned it coz I was not at satisfied with the phone. I used to use Moto X Play. It was Full HD display. Where as this is jus HD display. The sound quality is very bad as lot of reviews stated. You have to literally stick your phone to your ear to talk to somebody even if u are not in any noisy place. None of the ear phones of AUX wires would fit the ear phone's jack. Althogh the battery back up is great! I didnt not charge the phone completely for 3 days (meaning full charge, I was charging it for half an hour or something) and i could use it without much of a problem. I personally would not recommend this phone if u are looking for good camera, touch and voice quality.
