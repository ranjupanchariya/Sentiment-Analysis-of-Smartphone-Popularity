Battery consumption of screen is too much, however low brightness you may keep. If you keep screen on for about 45 minutes by way of browsing or using any application; the battery drains by at least 10%. Phone heats up too much if you talk for even 5 minutes on speakerphone. I request reader of this review to consider other options. I am repenting for buying this phone.
