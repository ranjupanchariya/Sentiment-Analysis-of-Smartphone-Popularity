Flipkart's service was as disappointing as the faulty piece they delivered to me. They took 12 days to deliver the product. On the 5th day, I got a call from customer care assuring me of delivery on the next day (6th day). I ended up wasting an entire day at home waiting for the phone while the phone was rotting in the warehouse since day 3 which is hardly 45 minutes away from my place. Finally I received the much anticipated phone on the 12th day only to find out that it went into an infinite reboot loop after updating to android 5.1. I was told by the motorola guy to get it replaced from flipkart due to lack of a solution to the problem. God knows how long they will take to deliver the replacement now. Any guesses?
