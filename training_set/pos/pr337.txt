I came from the HTC rezound, which had broken down and needed to be sent back to verizon 3 times during my two year contract. this s4 so far has good battery life, excellent screen, some useful features, some that do not work so well,  the air play only works if you are using the samsung web browser, not googles.  I have only had it 1 month, so I will review again after 6 months"
