I just upgraded to the 5s and needed protection. For me the phone is very nice to look at so I did not want to cover it up, these work great for that. They can be changed very easy and to match other items you may carry. The other one for sale are very high priced for my sanity but you get 10 of these for a wholesale price! The but tens work fine and the edge is rubber so it stays put. The colors are vivid and well chosen. I had one that was bent but it was fine after keeping it on the phone for a few days. So far none has messed up. It took about two weeks to get them but well, well worth it. The quality is exactly like the name brand ones.
