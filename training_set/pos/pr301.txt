Just got the new T-mobile Lumia 521 for $95 from Amazon. Set up was easy. The hardest part was having to cut my existing full size sim card down to the new micro sim size ( but I found very useful videos on YouTube uses at your own risk) after that I inserted the card FIRST then let it boot up and do the first time set up and I was good to go!!!!! I can make calls get texts and pictures text.  So happy with this phone!! got Twitter, 6tag (instagram) and facebook and kik messenger working great never going back to Android!!
