his is a really nice designed battery pack.  It has a very pretty shiny case that makes it look like a very high quality item.  Of all the battery pack AON series this is the nicest.  The down side is that you don't have a micro usb port to charge. I really like the convenience of having it but I can't complain considering how much more you can charge.I was able to charge my Olympus camera along with my Samsung note 2.  The charge speed was quite fast and comparable to the AON series 2, 3 and 5. So I can't complain about it. I've tested all of these AON chargers and the 2 and 4 are probably my favorites.  I like the 2 for the size and I like 4 for the design and features.It's a little heavy so I'm not so inclined to carry it around on the daily use but it would be good for a person traveling long distances without a charger.  I've had my share of times running out of battery life on my camera - bad timing when you want to take a bebeautiful picture.This is a great buy and I recommend this for the traveler but not for the daily user who likes to carry a battery pack around.  I received this item for an honest review
