Seriously, this phone has the most amazing screen I've ever seen. Its very fast, even with the typical android non smoothness. It does tons of non useful gimmicky things that we all know about by Now. The greatest part about the phone is also one of the hardest things to adapt to, the huge screen. Its very hard to reach the opposite corner. I'm actually a fan of the plastic,  aluminum is cool looking but scratches if you look at it crooked. At the end of the day this phone is sweet and I would give it five stars if only I didn't miss my iPhone 5 so damn much. The screen is small and the os is old, but the little things... I'm not going to go into detail about them all, bit the smoothness, the one handed use, all the little things add up and I miss my iPhone badly.
