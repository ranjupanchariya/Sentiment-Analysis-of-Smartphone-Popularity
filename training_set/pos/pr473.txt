My first BB and Absolutely awesome..But why blackberry 10 OS not as high which must be?It must be the Best OS what to call it yes INNOVATIVE .BB You have to support your customers.No apps that's the only problem for some. But for me just all I needed.For Browsing this is WHAT I need.This is not for social or gaming until no app support.Multi tasking it's what to say the real multi Tasker . BB Hub it's dam good one ie all in one.Some says video viewing is not good.But it's something you have to try it.After watching video browsing etc I just turn to my that phone(I don't want it's name here) to check mail.Oh god it's just a crap in size.But I love that phone too:-).Some says it's not 4g it's giving me download avg 20mbps with 4g lte in backward area.Its not your mistake it's not mentioned as 4g support in details but it's 4g support and I'm using Airtel as my carrier.You can use Jio sim for data but no voice call and and no Jio voice app.Battery 4G it's 7hrs hard 3G it's 10-12hrs moderate 2days sure.Its heat Some on edge for heavy use but not as some says like useful for cooking.For Sound oh my god it's something I never can't explain it's totally unique.Images videos on beautiful screen.Camera sorry front worst in indoor and not for camee's.Some says focus not working but till now no such issue may be in sometime let me see.Build quality pakka.Feel some hard to use with it as first timer but still in my hand loving it.Now I'm a royal guy in public.First when they see brand they laugh at me.When I show some work out with my phone they put their phone inside pocket.A first time BB user review and that's too on passport.I take challenges risk and want change that's why I go for this not looking others views.But strictly for business professionals. I got box manufactured and imported date as Aug 2016 without any stickers paste on top just like alteration.Androidians and iPhone casual users don't buy it.You can't do anything on this.You can if you want different taste as a professional.I got best in quality no problem until now.Will review later after 1 month use.Dont know about future support but until it's dead it will be my daily driver.Forget to mention supercom the seller thank you.You got my respect.
