As most of people if not everyone else, we got this to replace the cutting edge phone for our 80 years old mother, she loves it. It works as advertised. It would be great for kids first phone as well. It's a bit pricey for this simple phone. The buttons are a bit sticky and recessed too much for reach. Very loud and clear. Good phone!
