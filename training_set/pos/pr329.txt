I have been using an Android smart phone for a couple years now. Specifically, it's an LG Optimus M. It was pretty impressive when I got it, but it's worn out its welcome. It's not really all that smart, and I'm sick to death of the storage issues.I knew I wanted a new phone and was thrilled when Vine offered me this one. Wow. This is really an outstanding phone. It is more like a tablet or laptop than any phone I've used. The technology is astonishing.I am particularly impressed with the high quality camera and videos. This is a phone that you can actually watch TV shows, Netflix, etc. on.I am familiar with Windows products, though I have not yet purchased Windows 8. Still, I was up and running quickly and found most of the functions to be intuitive. This is, however, a Windows product, so there were the inevitable glitches that happen with all Microsoft products.Ultimately, it's worth it. This is a fine phone and one that should keep me happy for a long time.Other than the occasional Windows issues, I wish an expensive item like this came with a screen protector and a minimal case to protect it. Also, there are nowhere near the number of apps that are available for the iPhone and Android phones. Hopefully, that will change, but my nagging worry is that Windows phones will never catch up to these other types of smart phones.But right now all is well, and I have the coolest phone of anyone I know.Fancy, Sophisticated Smart Phone
