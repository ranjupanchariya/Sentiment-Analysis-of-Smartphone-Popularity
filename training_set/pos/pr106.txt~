Just got this beautiful looking phone after my class 12th results, as a gift from Mum Dad.The design is STUNNING and touch is very smooth.Reason I chose this Lava X81 is for its camera features. So looking forward to clicking some superb pics of my college life.I have already captured some really GREAT videos with its SLOW MOTION feature.Till now, it is not having a single hang or any other problemâ€¦ I have been constantly playing games, music and video.All in all, I am really EXCITED about using this phone since this is my first ever smartphone.
