This is an amazing device. TouchFlo 3D is a great addition to this phone and makes is very easy to access the features you want to get to quickly. The keyboard is the best I have ever used and is far superior to software (on-screen) keyboards found on other devices. Media features are excellent. Great music and video playbackand the devices supports stereo bluetooth. the camera is great for a camera phone and takes great pictures in daylight, and even does ok in low light. The MP4 video recording is also of decent quality. The screen on the Fuze is amazing with the 480x640 resolution. Pictures and movies look great and text even when viewed very small is astoundingly crisp and clear. One of the best features about bout this phone is its excellent way in which it handles your emails. Extremely easy to view, access, and manage 3-4 email accounts. I use my Outlook Exchange, Gmail, and Yahoo on the phone and love the email management. The phone is very easy to cutomize to make it work and look the way you want it to. Thousands off applications available on websites like [...] to outfit your phone with useful apps, games, etc. Overall this is an excellent phone and I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants the most powerful smartphone currently on the market.
