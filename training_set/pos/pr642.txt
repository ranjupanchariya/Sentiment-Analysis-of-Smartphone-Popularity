Very nice product. Excelent screen resolution, superb quality of camera. 2gb ram doesnt do wonders but ok performance. Very nice touch response, i dont like the back pouch comingwith the phone, when I just tried to remove it ,it is broken hard. Very nice looking earphones. 2200mah battery just taken 1.5 hr to charge fully. Otherwise some lagging feeling. It is a very good product at this price.
