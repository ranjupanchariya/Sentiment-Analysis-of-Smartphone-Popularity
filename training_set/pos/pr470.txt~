The os of bb Passport is a dream software. Its so user friendly that it literally makes the likes of Apple,Samsung and others.redundant. The hardware has solid built like quality feel to it. The phones square design does feel awkward and takes time getting use to.Congratulation to BB for coming out with a product like this one.
