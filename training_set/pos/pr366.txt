I just got my phone today & it seems to be made of good quality, speaker is okay when listening to music but it's a little low when i watch netflix or hulu. I love the size of it. mines looks a little different from the pic because it doesn't have the BLU logo on the front. Hopefully I'll be able to get 3g on it (ill update later), text & talk works fine haven't been able to get pic msg yet (ill update later). I haven't noticed any lag and Ive downloaded all my favorite apps/games. I also have a 32gb micro sd  card installed.Update; 3g & pic msg works great. I'm using mines with Straight talk so I had to change the APN settings.Update 9/13/13: Netflix doesnt work. BLU say they are working on a patch to fix it or a update to fix it.
