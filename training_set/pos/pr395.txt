I just bought the Motorola KRZRZ K1 phone from China ,I was a bit leary ,but this phone is hard to get at a reasonable price.The phone arrived and right away the 7 key would stick and when I hit it again I would get two 7's.This cleared up and the 6 started to do the same thing .Then all of a sudden everything was fine.I gravitated from the Motorola v3 which I wasn't crazy about ,could never see the keys in daylight .The Krzrz K1 is such an improvement ,much better voice ,beautiful blue color ,very easy to navigate ,but best of all the battery lasts a full 5 days on standby .It has always bothered me that phone manufacturers promise 10-12 days and you only get 2 days when theyre new .Nokia is the worst offender.The bad on this phone is the voice recognition ,you don't train it,you just speak the name ,but I have yet to see this phone get it right.Enunciating doesnt help and turning the sensitivity up or down doesn't either .The phone will give you 3 choices to agree with the recognition and usually all three are wrong ,so I have to scroll down to the name I want to call it's quicker.However since I mostly need tags in the car when I'm driving I have trained the car voice recognition to work ,and thats what I mostly use.Lastly I paid $45 for this phone and I couldnt be happier.It's unlocked ,I use T-Mobile and I can use it in Europe.For me a cell phone is not a toy ,so I don't play games,text message or go onto the internet otherwise I would have bought a smart phone,and although this phone has a camera ,I probably will never use it except in an emergency ,and music, I use my ipod .For an outstanding phone this one can't be beat.
