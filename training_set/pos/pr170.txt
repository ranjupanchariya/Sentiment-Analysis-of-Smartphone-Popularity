Hi !! My Review for Micromax Canvas Turbo A250 purchased on 12-Dec-2014- Flipkart delivered the product on 14-Dec-2014 (on Sunday) i.e. in 2 days only, Top Class delivery services- Product ratings in 9/10- Good thingsGreat color display, Fast, Light weight and sleek, Great Camera, Great Sound- Not so goodGot slightly warm while using wifi, but cool down quickly when wifi switched off(but this happen with other phones as well like my earlier Samsung and Nokia Devices)
Android 4.2.1 jelly bean ver. is bit older now, when there are 4.4 Kitkat availableOverall, Its a best product in this range. No product could even come closer to this.Next best competition was atleast 4000/- costly from this including Karbon & Spice I am enjoying this great phone !!
