I have been an iPhone user for the longest time and even after the release of multiple Samsung product releases, I was unimpressed. What switched me over finally was this incredible phone. Wireless charging, a SLR like camera, NFC, and a slick new operating system. This is the phone to buy. You will not regret it.
