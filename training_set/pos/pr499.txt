Have rarely seen such a complete device...it is obviously beyond a phone.I would not even try to compare it with iphone6 or anything...it is a different market segment that the BB PP attracts and talks to.The form factor is perfect...it takes two days to get used to it (after having use the same form factors for over three to four years with Samsung / Apple etc etc)..Battery is a god send...near unbelievable...and that is a key point for a professional.BB has really put in deep research to take such a call...and it is worth it every bit.
