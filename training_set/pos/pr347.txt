I'm sorry low rating android haters, I'm a verified purchaser of two Galaxy S4s (see my uploaded images for proof) and this phone is simply amazing.  I'm a former iPhone 3gs/4/4s user and I know just how good android had coming along the years.Extremely beautiful screen, extremely light and crazy thin, very easy to put in any pocket.Awesome camera, as good as the iPhone 5, even better, because with iPhone you have to manually click on screen to focus, and no face detection on iPhone.Super fast 4 core processor, and never ending ram space.  You can keep as many apps open as you like, without ever feeling slowing down like the iPhone when you had like just 10-15 apps open in the background.The gimmicks (eye scrolling, air gestures, s-beam) are fun, but I turned those off immediately after I got my phone, this will also save you more battery and ram space.Battery life is simply AMAZING.  You simply can't run this beast down in just one day.  I get average 1.5-2 full days of use depending on usage.  Included 2.1 Amp battery charger also charges this phone blazing fast, just few hours is all you need to completely charge the battery juice.I installed Nova Launcher (it's free) from google play to replace stock TouchWiz, and haven't looked back.  I suggest you try the Nova Launcher as well.Verizon's Network is no doubt #1, as I have used all 3 major carriers, 4G is blazing fast, and 3G is also very fast.***Also as a side note note, even though Amazon price is cheaper than Verizon official site, if you read though Amazon's contract terms, you'll notice you must keep your Verizon line of service active for at least 6 month to avoid from being charged a $400 dollar termination fee from Amazon, besides the usual ETL that Verizon is gonna charge you.
