ove the phone. Upgraded from a Droid Bionic, and I couldn't be more happy. The only drawback I've found is the auto-correct feature not changing your words for you on the fly (you actually have to tap the suggested word to make the change complete), so texting can be a bit annoying for people with thick fingers.I'm thrilled with everything else, though. A solid phone through and through.
