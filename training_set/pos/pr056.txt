Excellent phone that worked flawlessly out of the box. It's my first day using it but I'm very impressed by how easy & fast the update to ICS 4.0.3. was!Note inside package sacred me as it indicated that the phone is not for Verison customers but so far I encountered no issues using Verison SIM card (did not have time to setup SMS or MMS yet).Phone is very fast & screen response is amazing. I have been using the phone to make calls & surf the web with very good battery life. Charger footprint is excellent & fits well in a crowded outlet.I'm very pleased with this purchase & the seller who included a note on how to change the language to English (my phone came with German as the default language).
