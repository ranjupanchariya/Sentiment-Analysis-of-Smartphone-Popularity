Its a very nice phone. Very light weight. It covers all the new features like VoLTE etc. Camera quality is very good. Display quality is also good. Earphone sound is excellent. But Delivery is not good. I am requesting to Flipkart that please don't send all of my products with Blue Dart. They are not deliver the product at the given addresses. Everytime they are saying that this is not under our delivery area but other courier services are delivering on these addresses. We have to collect our product directly from there office which is very far away. If we have to collect it from there office then what is the benefit to purchase it online with home delivery. Hence requested to Flipkart, please don't send my products with Blue Dart.
