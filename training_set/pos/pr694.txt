The HTC One is a great looking phone.  I have the anodized blue Best Buy version so I wanted a case that didn't cover up the good looks of the phone. The back of the phone is protected well.  Holes for the camera, flash and speaker are in the proper locations.  There are cutouts on the right side for the volume rocker and the top and bottom are fully exposed. This includes the top portion of the phone over the speakers.  This is a problem for some and I must admit that it does bother me a little when I'm placing the phone on the table face down.  There is a little bit of an edge on the sides that keep the phone raised off a flat surface (when face down).  The case adds very little bulk to the phone and I think it improves the grip of the phone.  The bare phone is a bit silky and slippery.Typically I'm easy on phones and don't need a whole lot of protection.  The exposed portions on the top of the phone do concern me and I have to remind myself not to place the phone in the same pocket as keys or loose change. Other than that the case does what it's supposed to do.  I can already see the thin scratches from daily wear and can imagine what that would look like if I didn't have the case on.Overall I'm happy with this purchase
