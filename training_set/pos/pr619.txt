It has got an amazing camera. High quality. Phone is very light weight and very smooth to use. Battery back up is very good. Very good for single day use with full battery charge. Speakers are good. I'm using for about a week and no lag so far. I would recommend oppo A37 at this price range instead of lenovo/moto phones...
