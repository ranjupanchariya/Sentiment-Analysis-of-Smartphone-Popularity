Have been using passport for about 3 weeks now and is extremely satisfied with it.The phone is very fast and havent got stuck or slow even once till now. The build quality is great and i think no other smartphones currently in the market can match passport in this department. Also the 3450 mAh battery lasts really long.The best thing I liked about the phone is that it does all the features that is expected to be done by the phone extremely well. I am able to hear and speak in areas having low reception areas extremely wel. Messaging, email and whatsapp are really cool and easier through the blackberry hub.I have seen many people bashing the display of passport telling that since its a square display, videos cannot be watched properly and it will get black areas above and below the picture. But still the videos are 4.5 long horizontally and I think thats a pretty decent display. Also the speakers produce very clear and loud sound.Browsing net and reading pdfs are really smooth and is better than the regular rectangular phone. Due to its 4.5 width, web browsing experience is almost similar to that of pc.The only problem I felt with this phone is that playing games in the square screen is not good. But i dont think thats a drawback as this phone is not built for that purpose.
