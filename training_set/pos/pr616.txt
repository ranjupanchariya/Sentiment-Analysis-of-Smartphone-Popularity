I have used this phone for a month.... Actually phone is less weight & thin and sleek. Easy to handle it. Performance is good & battery holds for long time. No heating issues. Only thing camera is average quality but with other camera apps it's look good.. I recommend you to buy this phone when compare xiomi, lenova etc..
