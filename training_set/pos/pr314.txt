Windows is what you're buying here more than a phone.Going on three months with the Lumia 521.No regrets here for the 99 dollars paid.This isn't a glistening shiny hefty phablet that is seen being clutched by so many these days.It's just an easy to use 4 inch screen smartphone with all those features wanted by us late comers.I'm older and retired and found this device very friendly and enjoyable to use.I like this phone so well I bought another one.Good job Nokia/Microsoft!
