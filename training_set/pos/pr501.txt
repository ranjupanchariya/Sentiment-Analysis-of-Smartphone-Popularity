Review after using two days. I like this beauty very much. If you compare other branded phones with this you will not get better than this one without camera. very smooth. Good music sound, no voice leakage, good battery backup. One more reason I purchased this one is because this is the Microsoft's first (after take over Nokia) and last feature (basic) phone with name Nokia. So I wanted to keep it with me. The only cons I found in it is charger getting heated a lot like it will bust soon.
