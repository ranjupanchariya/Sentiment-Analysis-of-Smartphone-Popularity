When I first got my phone I had considered picking up an extended battery, but really liked the slim profile and lightweight feel of the S3. A few months later, when my S III started dying before I could make it home after work, I decided to pick one up. I'm glad I went with the ZeroLemon model, even though my phone looks and feels like a brick now it's worth it for the added battery. I went four days without charging my phone the first time I used the battery, which was wild. Installation was a breeze and I haven't had any issues since putting the battery into my phone. All in all, a great purchase!
