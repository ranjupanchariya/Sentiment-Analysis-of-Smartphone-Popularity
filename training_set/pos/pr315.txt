I purchased this phone as an entry device into the Windows Phone 8 mobile OS and so far I am not disappointed. I can't believe the amount of good free apps that was included with the phone. Nokia Music pretty much grants me free offline music and Nokia Here Maps is a surprisingly nice and detailed offline GPS app. You can download the maps and then access the GPS offline. (Great for those on prepaid and don't have an extensive data allotment) Currently only gripe about this phone is the lack on internal storage available for apps. Although it has a microsd expansion slot, you cannot move apps to the the sdcard. The microsd card is only used to house your media (music, videos, pictures, etc.) After I installed &#34;Halo: Spartan Assault&#34; I was pretty much left with little to no space for other apps.
