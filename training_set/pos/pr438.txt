Can't beat it for all in one device, especially if a camera is important. Video quality is good as well. Navigation is good. Included accessories are great. You can actually connect this to TV via HDMI with included cables. Battery life exceeds most devices I've used. Email works well.I have a DSLR. The camera is not as good of course, but pictures matter to me and I will take and print pictures using this camera. With other camera phones I think 'what's the point?' and don't bother. I leave my DSLR at home unless I want to get creative
