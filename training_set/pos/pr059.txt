I've had many other smartphones. This one blows them all out of the water. Even the iPhones. I use my phone for all the non-phone stuff more than phone stuff, so this is the ticket for me.I'm used to using the giant phone as a phone now too. The screen is amazing for all the other stuff like browsing, maps and video... god the video! You can see the screen outdoors too (a deal maker/breaker issue for me). It's a clear 1080hd screen too. The video out to TV works flawlessly.Ok, couple cons (since glowing about the phone isn't helpful... but believe me, it's awesome)...The battery life under non-phone use isn't great. It gets me through the day, but I have to charge it every night. I'm a heavy internet/GPS/Video user, which all sucks battery quickly.I would LOVE a dedicated HDMI out port. The USB one works well, but it monopolizes the USB port, so you can hook up a hard drive AND output to the TV.If you're not the kind of person that needs/wants the big big screen though, get the Galaxy S3 instead.
