Everywhere I go,,People ask me is that a Phone..And when I tell them \"Yes\", The next reply is \"Wow\", I want one...When I first got this phone, My first thought was it was a Pretty Big Screen for a Phone..But now having it for 4month's, I would not trade it for nothing..Not even the Iphone S, (Which I had before the Galaxy). The Display Is Great for Movies & Game's. And the Sound is Another Plus for me. Only negative thing on the phone is the battery, I usually can't get thru a full day without having to charge...But other than that,,I love It!!!!It's a Must on anyone's List!!!
