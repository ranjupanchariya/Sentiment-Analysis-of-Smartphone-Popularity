It's a nice phone, owned it for a while now, sometimes have issues with lag and whatnot but I think I complain just because I'm still an Apple fan. The only thing I can say is DO NOT BUY the 64gb sandisk cards for it, for some reason those cards like to stop working a bit after use, in turn losing any pictures, app, games, etc. you may have on it, and that's not just me talking, i've see countless forums with hundreds of people having the same issues, it's something to do with sandisk and samsung, still haven't figured it out and I've had the card since I bought the phone when it first came on the market, so money wasted on a card that worked for about 5 days then suddenly the phone couldn't find it.
