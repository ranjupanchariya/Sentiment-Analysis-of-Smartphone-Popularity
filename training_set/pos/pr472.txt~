I was super excited to get this piece of technology. I was utter disappointed to see that the packing was very old torn and untidy. The manufacturing was Oct, 15. Well, that did not deter me from opening and checking out the phone. It as a brand new piece. I would rate this more than 5 if I could but I take away 1 star for the following1. The mobile was for use in European country. Charger was flat pin. Its compatible for both 240 v and 110 v. Have to buy an adapter.2. The Flipkart Customer Care representative was decent enough to say that the material would be original but could not tell me that it was either Indian or Imported.3. Un-boxing was not pleasant. I was disappointed that packaging was not good at all.4. I was also disappointed that it was suppose to arrive on 9/2/16 but came on 5/2/16. This was disappointing since I had ordered other accessories accordingly. Now I use this without these accessories and have to be extra careful.
