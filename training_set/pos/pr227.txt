It has been an awesome experience with the Micromax Canvas A250. The phone is a beast among the smartphones. I have been using it mainly for Camera and Gaming (Calling but natural).The phone never hangs and the picture quality of the pics taken from it are awesome. Even the front camera is praiseworthy.A must buy if you are confused between Samsung and Micromax.
