Owned for 1 year. Root attempts: 1 (success first try) I loved this phone when i first got it but now that i own a Note 2 the Note 1 seems a little slow to load apps after having a few aftermarket background processes like yahoo mail, auto sms, multiple game auto update's etc.Pros:-very fast with stock Android OS-Dropped it twice with case and took zero damage.-Even with only 8GB internal and the 8GB SD i have, i never really seemed to run out of space but using Google+ auto picture/video upload feature is highly recommended because you can just delete the videos once they are on Google+-Pros definitely outweigh Cons, so i do recommend this product but if you can afford to get a Galaxy Note 2... get the International N7100 instead... every thing loads faster and the 2GB RAM on Note 2 makes a HUGE difference.Cons:-Somewhat little laggy with Jellybean 4.1 or higher-Battery doesn't last very long with normal to medium-heavy use, especially after installing a Jellybean ROM. I recommend having at least 1 spare batteries to swap out in the middle of the day if you play a game here and there.-Lose about 5 to 8 feet of range on wifi if you have a protective case on it but this seems to happen with all phones or ipods that use wifi.
