Love it so far.  The camera does much better job than my roommate's iphone 5.  I really like that.  I also like windows 8 although it has less apps than iphone does.  I don't play a lot of game.  This phone serves well for me.  Good talking quality and decent camera lens.  Bigger screen than iphone 5.  I love it.
