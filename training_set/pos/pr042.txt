I upgraded from the N95 8Gig (also a seriously great phone) to this.  I love both, but I prefer the N96 because it has a bigger memory plus the ability to expand.  I added an 8Gig cardSanDisk 8GB MicroSD Card  ( SDSDQ 008G A11M)and have loaded lots of music and movies.  In preparation for a trip I am loading other movies on additional cards so I can switch them out.  Although watching on such as small screen takes some getting used to, this expansion feature is enough for me to favor this over the N95.  The quality of videos is excellent, but I don't recommend you try to watch films with subtitles :-).The only minus of this v. the N95 is that the N96 has a noticeably shorter battery life (only on standby and voice calls).  I only had to charge my N95 every few days; this one needs it every day or two at the most.The camera is excellent.  In fact, it is the only camera I used on a recent trip and the still pictures and videos are as good as my very expensive (and very heavy) camera.  Having only one thing to carry in my pocket without sacrificing picture quality was wonderful, (and the phone/camera was envied by all who saw it).The phone has lots of useful features even if, like me, you don't subscribe to a data package.  I use the phone to attach to wi-fi when out and check my e-mail, shop at Amazon, etc. This does not use the cell service and so there is no data charge.I still haven't figured out the GPS system, but then again I haven't spent very much time on it.  Not everything on these phones is intuitive and the written instruction book is lacking, but Nokia has an excellent web site with all the information I have needed to answer my questions.This phone is really expensive, but it is worth it.  Highly recommended for anyone with the desire for a great smart phone the ability to buy it.
