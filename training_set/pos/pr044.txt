I started very slowly learning all the features of the Nokia N96. My former phone was fairly basic, and when I first started enjoying the many features of the N96 I became excited about the myriad of new things I could do--once I learned how.At the heart of the large 16 gig internal storage is the Symbian OS. Awesome. What a welcome relief from Windows Mobile. There is an easy transfer of files from an external memory source. It uses a mini SD card.This gives one flexibility in various types of categorized external files.I immediately noticed how clear the incoming calls were. Sometimes on other units I have had a bit of a problem understanding the audio from an inbound call particular those which have static interference.  The Nokia has very good audio properties, and the sounds are crisp. The speaker phone is a good feature on the N96 because the other party doesn't realize you are using this feature. There is an absence of feed back.Downloading the various features was easy as I took things a step at a time. The internet access works very well. At home it works flawlessly with my wireless router. WLAN can be tricky, and I was very surprised how easy it was to set up on the N96.The most interesting surprise of the N96 is the camera. Wow. The graphics are beautiful. Love the 5MP resolution of the camera, and coupled with the clearness of the 2.8 inch screen the photo viewing is spectacular for a device this small. There are many options in sorting your digital photos. Thumbnails are nice. The TV connection gives an added ability to view your photos on your TV screen. Also I like the fact they included AC and Car chargers.The FM radio expands both music contact and keeping in touch with the local news. This feature was emphasized when I was able to keep in touch with our local media during recent severe weather.Nokia quality is certainly evident in every phase of the N96.
