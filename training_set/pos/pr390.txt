I have had this phone for 2 months now.First, the GoodSize, Call Quality, User Interface, Volume, Virgin pricing plans, web extras.It is very thin and can be stuck in any pocket without making it look like you just shoplifted half the store. The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones.Now, the badButton size, battery life, built in extras.The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone. I had to go online and pay more for a ringtone than I would for an entire song from iTunes.
