I work from home and use VOIP (Ooma) connected to a Panasonic phone.  I've tried 3 different headsets that plug into the panasonic phone but can never hear the other parties very well from the headset.  When I'm not traveling and working from home I spend approximately 4 hours a day either giving webex demos - talking on the phone - or on conference calls.  I purchased this Plantronics and I have to say, the quality is impeccable.  Loud, crystal clear sound both ways.  Exceptional product, I highly recommend.
