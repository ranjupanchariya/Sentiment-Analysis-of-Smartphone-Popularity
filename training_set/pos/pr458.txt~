As a phone I'd give it only 3.5 - 4 stars.  As a fashion accessory its a full 5 stars!  This little phone us unique and stands out as different from all the traditional brick style smartphones.  Looks and Cute factor are off the charts, and my daughter loves this phone because its different.  Id have to agree with her (as a fashion guru goes ~ she's 14 and a trend setter in fashion - not so much haute couture, but maybe more like a to her classmates ~ and she does start fashion trends amongst her friends.Update:While there are no complaints about the phone, this update is a complaint about the seller. This phone was listed as UNLOCKED, but when my daughter went to use the phone, she kept getting a request for a sim.  Turns out the phone was LOCKED to a particular carrier. Had to pay an additional $10 for an unlock code.  Truly a disappointment on the seller.
