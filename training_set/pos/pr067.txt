I love my Samsung Galaxy Note (international unlocked version).  I have no problems fitting it into my front pants pockets.  It's got a huge screen that makes reading books and watching movies enjoyable.  It's fast and very responsive.  It's got tons of storage space, has a loud speaker, and convenient placements for buttons.  I highly recommend the Boxwave Duosuit slimfit case, because this phone felt very slippery to me, and before I got the case, I was constantly afraid that I was going to drop it.  I'm not very impressed with the functionality of the stylus or the note-taking apps (still running Gingerbread), but that's ok with me.  I'm fine with essentially what is a great phone with a huge screen.
