I've had my Storm for a year now, and have been debating whether to upgrade to the new Storm2 or the Motorola Droid. I had the opportunity to play with both phones, and I can confidently say that the Storm is the true winner! I like the fact that you can touch the screen but need to actually \"click\" down on the screen to open an app --whereas on the droid it opened whatever my fingers accidentally touched, and had stuff opening all over the place just from handling the phone!  The touch keypad is much more accurate (and I had less mistakes) on the Storm than on the droid. I also like that the Storm, now a year after its release, has become MUCH more stable due to consistent operating system upgrades. The new OS is much faster and more reliable. The camera and video camera work great, I have 16GB of photos & songs on the media card - which play as good as (if not better than) an ipod, there are TONS of apps and games, and the Bluetooth sync'd to my car is awesome! I also like how everything is organized much better, and easier to find (in logical places and menus)- which I could not find in the droid. I also use my Storm as an MP3 player and a radio when outside thanks to the Slacker Radio app and my Bluetooth headphone! Apps that I have installed on my Storm are: a GPS app that is very cool and works w/ the Blackberry Maps; a Level app that turns the Storm into a level tool; a Flashlight app to use the phone as a flashlight; a task reminder app; Bartender app; Photo paint app; a Travel/Pedometer app; Weather app; Unit convert app; YouTube, and of course Facebook. In playing with the new Storm2, the only thing I can say is it is a little bit faster, has more app memory than the Storm1, and has wi-fi. I believe that the Storm2 with wi-fi will really speed up the browser.  I think I will be upgrading to the new Storm2 rather than the flakey droid that I had the opportunity to play with. If you want the best, go with the Storm
