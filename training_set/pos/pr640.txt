Great product... Have been using it for almost 2 weeks. Bought this phone for my mom. She loves this phone. She browses for 4 hrs daily. And battery % is from 100 to 78% in 4 hrs.Grt display, love the display. It looks like a rich phone pricing abt 10-15k feels grt when holding the phone. Jio sim works on this phone. Which I bought the sim earlier in the previous phone I purchased.Best in ram. 940 MB ram left even after installing 18 apps from Google play.
