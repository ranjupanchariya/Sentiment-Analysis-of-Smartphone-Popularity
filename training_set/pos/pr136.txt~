See for me, looks really matter in any phone And the new launch of Lava- Pixel  is gonna be good investmemt for me! Metal body with glass back cover- its gonna look so sleek in my hand The fact that it has quad core processor with Android Lollipop and backed 2500mah is like a cherry on the cake! The high end camera is not so bad either
