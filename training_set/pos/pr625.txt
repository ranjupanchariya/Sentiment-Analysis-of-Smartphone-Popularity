I have just purchased this mobile from flipkart, at first delivery I got a Lux Soap instead of Mobile, which is replaced by courier service in between because packing is demaged. I logged a complaint to flipkart immediatly. Flipkart sent me the replacement with in one week. now I am too happy with flipkart service. Mobile is nice at look, good display quality. Awesome sound and bettry (1800 mAh). An average user can easily use the phone for 3 days after a full charge.
