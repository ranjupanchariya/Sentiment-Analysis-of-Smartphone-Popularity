I bought this phone for my 72 year old father in law. He has problems with his hands and had problems opening and closing slide and flip phones.  sim card and calls were clear. There was no problem with signal and call quality that is not normal for Ast in this area.The only problem with the phone was that it was hard for him to learn how to use it. With the lack of a real display and only a small window for text he had a hard time figuring out how to make calls. It took me a few minutes to figure the phone out and get numbers programmed into it for him also.  The interface is not very intuitive, even for me and I have degrees in is.Overall the phone is excellent and works well. The user interface could be a little simpler for a better experience for seniors that are not tech savvy
