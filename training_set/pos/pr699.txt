I will start off by saying I have been a LONG time customer of Verizon,and I do mean A LONG time customer,but lets face it,they along with AT&T; are getting greedy with their rates and even with heavily discounted service through my work I STILL pay $150 a month for unlimited data(yeah,and they are trying REAL hard to get me to upgrade so I lose the 'unlimited'part)limited texts and limited voice minutes,were I to have unlimited everything it would be +$200 per month,so decided to look elsewhere,I was dubious about Virgin but know the phone(the original was from AT&T; and friends at work have had them a year or more)and seems reliable,(or as re;iable as a phone can be)..........now(and I hope the ladies dont think I am being smart,BUT,my wife LOVES to flap her gums and talks for hours on the phone with friends,(then goes to visit them,go figure!!!!!!!!)so goes through ALOT of minutes,so this unlimited really appeals to me,so I bought her this phone as a trial run,(I figure its a good gamble,no contract etc)and I have to say we have had no problems with calls in or out like other reviewers have noted,the 4g works great(I did read all reviews so spent a few more bucks for an extended life battery that works well)........the internet works very well although I havent sprung the $15 extra a month to use it as a mobile hotspot,if I do I will update this review.The 3 g works well also,ahvent tried the wifi yet but will update as I try these things out.I live in Baltimore so am guessing that is why the service is good and havent dropped a call yet,(I am sure it will happen as even the mighty Verizon it happens.The phone is large but comfortable to use,I did note the manufacturer states not to hold the phone at the base as that interupts the signal as this is,apparently,where the ariel is,(why it isnt located in the top same as other phones I am not sure,just surmising it is due to all the goodies loaded in it),..................IF you are switching from a NON Android phone it will take alittle while to get used to,had no problems transferring contacts,picture and video from her Blackberry,used the bluetooth,which ofcourse,is quick and she is set up,havent had any phone 'freezing'as noted by other reviewers,so am happy about that.I am an 'a typical guy',dont use many minutes..........maybe 30 or so in a month,just rely on the usual neanderthal grunts.As I noted,the phone is large,but not ridiculously so,comfortable to use and to me,I really like the screen size,comes loaded with alot of apps I will rely on my 12 yr old niece to inform me of what they are and if I will need to use them!Phone feels substantial not heavy not light,I DO agree with another reviewer,the back case does come off alittle too easy but purchasing a protective case did remedy that minor irritant quickly,a word to the wise,it IS wise to buy a car charger too for those who talk and text alot over the period of the day.(that and the extended life battery were my first add ons for my good lady),now IF this is to be your first Android phone,be advised these ARE inelligent type phones and do alot of things automatically,ie when transferring contacts,pictures and video from another phone it will allocate them accordingly.............took me awhile after using my beloved Blackberry for so long but got up to speed ewith the basics REALLY quick and a visit to the HTC website made me realise this IS a good operating system,I am no boffin just an average Joe so somethings were hit or miss but picked it up after a couple of OOOFER moments.I would advocate buying directly from the Virgin website as if you dont like the phone you can return it within 30 days(other places like retail store will smirk at you and decline the return in most cases as the box is 'open',or buy from Amazon if they sell these or are fulfilled by Amazon,if not,check the return policy before buying incase this phone is not for you.I purchased this direct from Virgin as they are offering 20% off for awhile and have a good return policy.Customer care is the typical Sprint(not great).In closing we are
