The front camera has amazing clarity and all my pictures look amazing.Great phone to buy, really good features and options worth every penny spent in getting the phone. The battery backup of the phone is something that disturbed me, Iâ€™m glad I picked up Intex Cloud String V2.0. The battery lasts for 5 hours or more including wifi and with other apps open.The advantage of the phone is that it has a good processor and really good memory space which is expandable up to 32 GB.Great 5 inch display and the best apart is about the display is that its hd, one of the best in the market.The phone gives me the option to use 4G to make my life easier.
