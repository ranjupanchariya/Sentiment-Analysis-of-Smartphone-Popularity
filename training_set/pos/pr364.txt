I've had this phone for about a week and really like it. It's certainly not the best, the camera quality isn't great and the storage is sparse. For what I paid, it was absolutely worth it though! The only thing that I really dislike is the time it takes to charge! 34 minutes left at 95% but on the flipside the battery lasts a lot longer. So overall no huge complaints
