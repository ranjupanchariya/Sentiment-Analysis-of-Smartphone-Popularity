ly does weird routes that are not necessarily the best nor the fastest, but it will always take you to your destination,Three completely personalizable home screens that you can swipe left or right to access.  You can provide a shortcut to any of your apps (including third party ones), put in a list of your favorite contacts in a scrollable bar as a widget, get access to email, music player, etc.+ Gallery is now much improved in that you can multiple items at once for deletion or to email, instead of deleting one picture at a time, which was a huge problem in S60v5.+ General use is generally snappy in and out of menus.- Essentially what  should have been, it doesn't make huge changes other than the home screens, it just fixes up some of the bugs in S60 like the inconsistent double/single tap to open applications. Occasionally phone felt slightly underpowered, but these cases were few and far between- Overall, the user interface  is not as polished as Apple's iOS or Google's Android.  Things aren't always as intuitively placed as you would like.  But in terms of functionality, Symbian can do everything that the above two os can do, it just doesn't really make all the features as accessible.Bottom Line:This phone is extremely well built and has pretty much all the hardware options you can ask for in terms of camera, video shooting, build quality/materials, built in and free gps.  In terms of software, Noslags behind ios and Android, but it is fully capable, just not as polished.  The main draw for this phone, however, is the fact that it is unlocked.  Which means if you don't need a data plan (more importantly, if you don't feel the need to pay and additional $30 per month), you do not have to get one for this phone.  Nowadays, every carrier will force you to get a data plan for your phone, which in the long run, comes out to be much more than the cost of buying this phone unlocked .That was the big draw for me, and then the amazing camera and free gps were just bonus features
