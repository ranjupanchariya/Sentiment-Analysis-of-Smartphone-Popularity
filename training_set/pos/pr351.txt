This is a very solid phone packed with features. You may not use all the features, but will appreciate the ones you do. Appearance is good as the phone is decently thin and pleasing to the eye. For those complaining about the metal band or the plastic backing, please stop. 99% of you will get a phone case that will hide it forever. Why care about what something looks like that you'll never look at.The only thing I would be weary of is the learning curve. Both my parents got this as their first smart phone. It's trying to teach them how to use a smart phone in general that is tough, but it seems this phone can get a bit overwhelming for some. I know when I transitioned from my Incredible 2, I was trying to adjust to everything. Once you do though, the phone is great. I can't complain about much. Battery life is decent and the battery is replaceable, which is nice. Screen is bright and colorful. I know you can get these phones pretty cheap now because the S5 is out, but this phone is definitely worth getting for its now low price and features/capabilities. Also, I've heard some mixed reviews about the S5, so it may be safe to stick with a phone you know will work.
