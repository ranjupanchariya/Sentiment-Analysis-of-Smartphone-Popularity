Can't say much about AT&T;, my service is new.Suffice to say that Sprint has gone downhill, and then they dove into a mine shaft at the bottom of it.The HTC: wow. I went from a Palm Treo 700 to this, and just can't say enough about it. The weight and feel is awesome. The functions are really techy and confusing for non-techy people, however if you enjoy electronics with lots of toys, you will be just fine.The bad side: It's slow to toggle between screens. This is my first experience with Windows Mobile, and I can tell right away that Palm was far superior.I can't say much more yet, but this phone is new and any info may be helpful to new buyers like you.
