This is the most stable Treo I have ever owned.  With the great memory management app on the device, you can make sure you fully close applications and free up the device memory.  WiFi and Bluetooth work great, and the screen resolution is a real plus.  One downside on the design is the ridiculously difficult to remove back cover.  Unfortunately, the battery, the reset button, and the microSD card slot are all located back there.  The keyboard is a bit tight, but much easier to use than many devices I have owned and certainly better than the iPhone virtual keyboard.  The thin form-factor is also a major improvement over the brick-like past Treos - you can actually put this one in your front pocket or your shirt pocket!
