Whether this phone is Ok or not depends on what you expect out this phone. I have a Moto X2 and needed a separate phone for my corporate connection which is why I bought this phone.. This phone is perfect for calling and messaging only, though if anybody has used a qwerty/touchscreen phone before, typing messages might become an issue. The small screen size is a serious barrier to using it for internet activities like FB or Whatsapp (though they are pre-installed).Fantastic battery life, goes two and a half days with full charge and very high usage.Aluminised back cover does give it a premium feel Very good signal reception
