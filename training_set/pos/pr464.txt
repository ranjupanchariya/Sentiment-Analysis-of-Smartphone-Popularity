Have rarely seen such a complete device...it is obviously beyond a phone.I would not even try to compare it with iphone6 or anything...it is a different market segment that the bb pp  attracts and talks to.The form factor is perfect...it takes two days to get used to it .Battery is a god send near unbelievable and that is a key point for a professional.bb has really put in deep research to take such a call and it is worth it every bit.
