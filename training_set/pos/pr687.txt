My S3 is a great phone, but I chew through the battery in about 8 hours, requiring a mid day recharge.  Enter this bad boy, I can run for over three days without charging.  Have an all day conference call?  This battery will laugh at your conference call.  Want to video your all day city tour without a charger?  Not a problem.It's basically a replacement S3 battery attached to another battery that takes up the lower 2/3 of your phone.  To hold the behemoth in place, they supply a cover that you use instead of your S3 cover, which is surprisingly easy to remove.  The cover fits over the phone and holds the battery in place, but allows full use of the camera without interference. Ingenious!Of course it makes your phone 3+ times as thick, and 3 times as heavy but it still fits comfortably in your pocket and is comfortable to hold so who cares.  It charges fully overnight.  When you don't need it, pull it out after you finished charging it and use your regular battery.  When I put it back in after a month of non use, this guy is still 99% charged.It also makes a great spare, for times you forget to charge your battery, so I keep this one charged before I put it away.This is quite possibly the best product I've ever got.  It does what it was designed to do as elegantly as possible.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
