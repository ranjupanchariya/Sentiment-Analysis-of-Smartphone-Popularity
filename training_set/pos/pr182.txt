First look gives the excitement due to its glossy screen. It starts up well, sound well, captures snaps well, operates smooth. until you install some Apps.. Once loaded it aims at your mind. never mind for its 1.5GHz processor. its responds very slow and even denies to unlock or even glow the screen on pushing power unlocking button. I like its picture presentation over Nokia Lumia 800 though colour reproduction is at average. Finally its an average phone giving FHD Screen. for gaming Magnus is better choice over this.
