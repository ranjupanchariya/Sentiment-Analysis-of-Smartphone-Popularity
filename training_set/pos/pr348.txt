Oh well where do I start? Should I get into technicalities or review this phone in a language that everyone will understand - simple and easy. I have had every kind of cell phone out there - you name the brand and type, I have had it. For past few years I have been an avid Apple fan until I grew sick of their limited and restricted usage of apps and system. I also got tired of the small screen and decided to make the switch to galaxy s4.  Absolutely love this phone! It's not &#34;complicated&#34; at all as other imply. Yes the it's not as user friendly as apple with only 5-6 functional setting icons but once you group apps and setting you don't use and need  the rest is just as easy to use. #1 big plus for me is the size of the screen - I LOVE IT!!!!! I love watching movies on it, playing games, online shopping :)I also love the fact that I can apply different themes, icons, fonts and make any other system changes without &#34;jail breaking&#34; my phone or being stuck with what it came with. So personal customization is another big plus. You can always buy a new battery and replace it if needed, it's not built in. Camera taken clean pictures and has different modes allowing you to take cool pictures and videos. Also when you download other apps (non google) they don't crash your phone system or freeze it. In other words I am very happy with this phone, and I had several friends and family members buy this phone as well and they are all very pleased with it.
