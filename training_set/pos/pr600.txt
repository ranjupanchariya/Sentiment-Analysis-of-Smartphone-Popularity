Bought this phone for my mother, the screen is quite big and clear, the keys are big and comfortable. the looks of this phone is quite classy, it has a 5 mp back camera and vga quality front camera, both of which has flash, the back flash can be used as a torch. this has some apps preinstalled, like facebook, the fb app is too jumbled to navigate and select or write anything, but atleast now she can go to her home page and see what her relatives and sons have posted like pictures, posts etc. and as all the controls are almost same as the older nokia phones she did not take much time to get used to the controls. All in all a very good basic phone.
