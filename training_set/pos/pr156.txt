My friend has been using the Pixel V2 since it first came out and so far he has not run into any problems yet which makes me believe that is one hell of a phone. And now I definitely want to buy this for myself just because Lava has launched a prism blue colour limited edition plus because of its camera 13mp & 8MP, and features like the gif maker and the night pro.
