I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola 850....it's an improvement, but still doesn't meet my expectations.  Upon connecting, there are occasionally echos, but they go away soon, expecially if you turn down the volume.  Range is very limited.  Drops connection at close range occasionally.  Cheap feel; buttons don't feel solid.  Light weight and comfortable.  Maybe there are just limitations with Bluetooth technology, but I have yet to find a headset that provides a crystal clear connection that is reliable.  I'm spoiled after working in Japan, where all of the cell technology provideds crystal clear communications.
