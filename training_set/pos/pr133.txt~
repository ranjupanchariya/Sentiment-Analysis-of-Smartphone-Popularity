Fantastic phone.Fantastic is an understatement especially when you go by the price of it. 3GB RAM, good battery, elegant camera, smooth touch, Marshmallow version, 16 GB internal storage out of which around 9gb is available... Get a 32 GB memory card and this phone will please you for sure. I haven't faced any heating issues even after 3 hours of continuous usage.The battery gets charged from 10-15% to 100% in around 3 hours however it sustains for more than a day. Average usage would let battery run for nearly two days.so it's justifiable to keep this phone on charging for 3 hours. And of course for Flipkart for delivering a smooth performer
