I agonized over getting this phone for several months, mainly because of what people were saying about the weak battery. But boy were they wrong. This phone rocks. The battery is easily holding its charge, the reception is great, the phone is very cool, the screen fabulous, the features unbeatable. Basically, the NOKIA N75 is a \"smart phone\", which means it comes loaded with tons of applications. In addition, AT&T/Nokia also provide a CD disk, as well as a data cable. (Motorola does not!) Sure, it's a little fatter than my wife's RZR V3xx, but it isn't as long, and yes, it's bigger than the KRZR which I dumped because the first one was DOA and the 2nd started going bad after only one week. But this thing is dynamite. It's easy to read the screen, it has tons of applications, and the most important thing... it works as a phone! I mean, come on, isn't that the main reason we get cell phones anyway? We want to talk on them. And this is easily the best cell phone I have ever had. Run, don't walk, to get yourself one of them
