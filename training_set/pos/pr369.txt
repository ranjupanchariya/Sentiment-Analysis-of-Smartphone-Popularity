The phone is super fast and it feels great in the hand. Its exactly like a Samsung but at 1/3 the cost. It uses the simcard from my old phone, so no issues with photos and contacts. I get all the benefits of the Galaxy, without breaking the bank. It even comes with a cover and screen protector. I'm a BLU fan for life.
