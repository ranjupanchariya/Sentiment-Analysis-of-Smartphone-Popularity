I've been using this phone for about a week now, and I love everything about it! The camera is the best I've used on a mobile device, the build quality is a lot better than I expected, and the screen is absolutely gorgeous! The battery life is somewhat of a problem if you're a social app lover like myself, but if you just use your phone for texts and phone calls, you'll easily make it a full day! I do miss the apps that I had on iOS, but Windows App Store is quickly gaining some of the most popular ones, and has many alternatives for Instagram and Snapchat. Overall I'm pleased with this experience and love my Nokia!UPDATE: August 3; my birthday. Had to call Amazon again about a weird volume glitch where it would randomly go up and down on its own.. They called VZW and they confirmed it was a Hardware Issue, and authorized for it to be replaced. After that, Amazon gave me a link for a UPS label to send it back in.. Hopefully it won't take too long, I never realized how small the iPhone screen was! haha.UPDATE 2: August 6, they refunded the purchase instead of replacing it... I called and got the 928 exchanged for the BlackBerry Z10, and now, I'm having to replace this phone for smudges under the screen... I don't think I'll buy another phone through Amazon...
