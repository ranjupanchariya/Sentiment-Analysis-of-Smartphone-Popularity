Before i talk about it, i am going to say i upgraded from an iPhone 4. So you Apple fanboys don't say i am just a hater. :DI won't go too much into talking down the iPhone since most of you looking to switch from apple to android already know what you DO NOT like about your iPhone. Here are the reasons I LOVE this phone.1.)Android is Open Source - Meaning I dont have to jailbreak or even install a &#34;custom ROM&#34; to customize my phone to my liking. Just about anything you want is probably in the Play store.2.) Easy PC connectivity - Again because Android has an open platform. I plug in my phone to the USB port and BAM i can easily access my folders and just as easily transfer ANY kind of media file onto my phone. SWEEEETNOW ... yes there are many Android phones out there, but the Note 2 rocks because the screen is HUGE and beautiful.I dont use the S pen all that much, but in the few occasions that I do, it really comes in handy.The micro sd slot is a plus, especially if you like to put movies or photos to share on your device.On the downside, Samsung takes their sweet time to push Android firmware updates out to devices.The best thing and worst thing about this phone is that it's so BIG. Haha. Its just hard to find a nice protective case for this phone without adding a whole lot of bulk or too hard on your hands. I have big hands so it isnt that big a deal for me.This phone fits perfectly fine in my pocket also. (I Dont wear skinny jeans)
