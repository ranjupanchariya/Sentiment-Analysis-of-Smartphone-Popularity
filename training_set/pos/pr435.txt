I love the camera, takes great photos, the flash is functional. The navigation achieves satellite lock within a minute, even without a data plan. The maps are fairly recent (current is end of april 2012), and the traffic rerouting works.The battery cannot last the whole day on standby if 3G is enabled, so I am forced to leave phone in 2G mode. Nokia does not care about Symbian, so Belle Refresh is not yet available for US N8's, even though international N8 got it almost as soon as it was released in Aug 2012. This is still a good unlocked phone, but I wish Nokia would support it better.Also, for any warranty repair, the phone has to be shipped back to Nokia, and they will take the full 10 business days before even attempting to contact you and shipping it back. I sent the phone in for battery life dropping rapidly, had to wait almost three weeks to get phone back. (and since Nokia did not have grey in stock for replacement phone, I had to get an orange)
