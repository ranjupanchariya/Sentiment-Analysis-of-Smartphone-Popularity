Before purchase the phone i expect more about it but after purchase i am realy dispointed with battery and software like third party apps u cant move to SD card. Primary camara not up to the mark. its getting heatsup for normal use also.Battery is the main problem.Mobile design is very good with light weight. Its looking like a Apple phone.For normal use it is okay.Metal body is looking nice.Mobile touch is very nice
