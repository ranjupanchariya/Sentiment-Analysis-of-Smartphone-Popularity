I use this camping, in an area where I get no 3G, and one bar on my cell if lucky. With this andWilson Electronics Dual Band - 800-1900 MHz Magnet Mount Antenna with SMA Male Connector and 10-Foot RG174 Coax CableI get 5 bars on my phone and fast data transfer. I will mention that you have to keep your mifi and phone VERY close to the unit, but just use a bluetooth headset, and the mifi broadcasts its own signal, so I didn't find it troubling. I replacedWilson Electronics 801245 SOHO AG 60 Adjustable Gain Cell Phone Signal Boosterand aWide Band Directional Antenna 700-2700 MHzwithWilson Electronics 100-Foot WILSON400 Ultra Low Loss Coax Cable with N Male Connectorsand Wilson 952350-50' 400 Coax Cableand found that this worked as well and required 1/5 the set up time. TRY IT. FOr me, it simply blew my mind that it could work as well as the above stuff. Now as I mentioned I used it outside camping. The above stuff is much better suited for a house, but at least outside it didn't work any better than the mobile pro.
