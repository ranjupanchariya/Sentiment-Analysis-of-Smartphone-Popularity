Was definitely worth, have used it for a week and it has been a great experience. Major props to flipkart and ws retail.Would not go into major details, however the only con is that 16 GB internal memory( approx 12 for using), may not be suitable for some, especially those who like to store movies. Having a memory slot would have been great but still its not an issue for me, since 12 gb is more than enough.
