For this amazing price, the HTC Desire was the android comparison I looked at before I purchased the N8. So much bashing has taken place concerning Nokia's symbian - but mainly from \"review sites\". Actual owners hardly have anything negative to say. Having used both, I cant say which one is \"better\" as there are pros and cons to each, and each person has their own preference. Like other decisions, this one involves trade offs that the buyer must make. I chose the N8 because: Solid construction, gorilla glass, 12MP camera, HD video, FM transmitter, HDMI & TV out, 16GB storage, bluetooth 3.0, Nokia legendary reliability and the battery last days (not hours). If you are willing to forgo all these for the android experience, that's personal preference. In my opinion a pretty UI is not everything and Symbian ^3 is fast and responsive! Bottom line is the N8 is value for money (the camera alone is worth the price!). Just one more point for those who may have an \"issue\" with their phone - TRY UPDATING THE FIRMWARE!
