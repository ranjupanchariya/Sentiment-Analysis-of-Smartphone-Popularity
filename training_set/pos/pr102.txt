If you own a Samsung phone and you use it as an mp3 player as well, like I do, you know that they have those annoying slot style ports to plug in your headphones. I can only imagine that this is done to generate more sales of accessories. This type of adapter was for sale at the phone store for more than $15.00. The hands-free device ear buds were even more. But, here it is for $3.00!Does it work? Absolutely. Worth every penny.It took about a week to arrive.
