I needed a phone which has 4g and a camera with a wide selfie. Finally there is a phone which can actually suffice my requirements and that too within my budget! The most chic factor about Pixel V2, I must say is prism blue color and its metallic texture. It has quad core processor with Android Lollipop which is backed by 2500mAh is like a cherry on the cake! Looks like Lava- Pixel V2 would be a good investment for me!
