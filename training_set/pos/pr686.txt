I went over 2 days with heavy usage on my phone which is phenomenal, i was killing the stock battery in like 5 hours sometimes. I was able to get over 3 days out of it normally. It's totally worth it. I haven't had issues with wifi, I don't use NFC, I like the weight it adds and the cover is a nice texture. A must buy for anyone who actually wants to use their phone as much as they want without charging multiple times a day.Word of caution, the white case gets dirty pretty easy, and you are supposed to put the phone through 5 cycles, fully charged to dead, this can take a very long time and its kind of annoying because you never quite know exactly when it will die, it can sit at 2% for hours before finally dying.
