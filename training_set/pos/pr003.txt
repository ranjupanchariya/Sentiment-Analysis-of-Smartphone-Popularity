DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID...THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT
