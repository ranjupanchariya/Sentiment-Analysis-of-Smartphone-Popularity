Voice & DataPros: The voice is loud and clear and data service gives a consistent 4G-LTE speed when available. Data Sense app is also included so you can manage your data limit so you can better judge your usage by app via both cellular and WiFi.Cons: I cannot say anything bad here either.BatteryPros: This Lithium Polymer (2000mAH) battery boasts 1282.8 minutes of usage time, which I have only seen better from the Droid Razr Maxx HD with its 1920 minutes of usage time. However, the 424.8 hours of standby time in the Lumia 928 beats the Droid Razr Maxx HD's 372 hours of standby time. Personally, most of my time is spent quickly looking at the phone and putting it back in my pocket. I do use my phone often, however, it spends more time in my pocket than in my hand.Cons: The battery is not removable.StoragePros: This relatively inexpensive Smartphone comes with 32GB of internal storage (about 8GB is used up with the OS formatting). This is a very good value especially when compared with other comparable phones.Cons: Again I will mention the no external storage, this really does bother me.Operating SystemPros: Windows Phone 8 is a fairly new, intuitive, business ready OS that is ready to make its mark. The new redesign of Windows 8 (which will soon get back a start menu in version 8.1) is made with this same type of system in mind. The system comes with a phone version of MS Office which is ready to link to an Office 365 account or run on its own.Cons: Less apps available than in App World
