Got it at 15k. Decent specs and considering "Wolverine" endorsed this product, I was too happy to get it for my wife. She just needed a big screen, decent camera, good design and affordable phone. I didnt need top-of-the-line specs since she mostly uses whatsapp, fb and few social media apps.This one fitted the bill perfectly. Thanks to flipkart for amazing delivery time of 48 hours. This is what differentiates flipkart from others. Fast delivery, more payment options and after sales return and support.
