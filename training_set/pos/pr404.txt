I've rated several Windows devices in the last year. It's usually always the same story, at least for Nokia devices.The hardware is excellent. Everything you read about in reviews about the build quality, the feel of the device in your hands, the weight, the battery life, performance - It's all dead to real. Absolutely fantastic quality all around.Unfortunately, I just can't get on board with Windows Phone (or any Windows really). I've used (and still use for my desktop) exclusively Windows products for the last 20 years. It's 2014 now, and Microsoft just seems to have been left in the dust by Google and Apple. All of their software seems outdated, and just lacking a plethora of features that most people take for granted by now. In the case of Windows Phone, most notably for me is a notification center and a personal assistant (Like Google Now). Those two glaring omissions from the OS make this basically unusable to me. Google Now is understandably, still relatively new - but how does the phone not have some form of notification center? Wake up Steve!Some people probably would dock stars from their rating if they didn't like the OS, but that's not what this is about. Most people know what they're getting into when choosing between Windows, Android and iOS. The device is fantastic. The OS, I can't deal.
