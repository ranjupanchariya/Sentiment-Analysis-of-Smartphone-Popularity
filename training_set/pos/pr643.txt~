Honestly The smartphone is best under this price range but only two deffect like screen flickering and on/off button irritate more. I ordered two for Rs. 10398 on 23/10/2016. Champagne colour had screen flickering deffect and silver colour had on/off button deffect and these deffect come to know after guaranteed 10 replacement day as a result no one can replace rather go for service centre and waste his/her time. On/off button deffect means one has to wait to screen on after press this button. So overall I suggest you all to not to buy this rather go for intex cloud string hd for Rs. 4699, intex aqua view for Rs. 5999 and intex cloud S9 for Rs. 6499. Even though this smartphone has some special specificaction like sos feature and on there other hand if we talk about it's performance it is being run on Chinese chipset called spreadtrum sc9832a which is overall less than qualcomm and mediateck. After all decision is your.
