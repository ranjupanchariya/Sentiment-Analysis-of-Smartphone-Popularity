I changed jobs, and the corporate standard is the Blackberry, so I had to give up my much-loved Treo 650. At least I was able to keep my number and swap the old SIM into the new phone.Overall I'm fairly happy with the 8700c. I miss the five-way joystick: navigating in Google Maps is a bit awkward. (Alt+scrollwheel for side-to-side). The keyboard is OK, but \".\" should have a dedicated key. I find the phone sound OK, although some people that I call report high noise levels.The biggest issue is switching between silent/vibrate and ring modes. The Treo gets this right: there is a simple, easily visible, sliding switch. You can see instantly what mode you're in, and can switch into silent mode without even removing the Treo from its holster.On the Blackberry I have to unlock it (using my password) and get back to the main menu screen just to SEE what mode I'm in (interpreting a small multicoloured icon). If I need to switch modes I then have to scroll to the Profiles applet, select it, choose the right profile, and apply it - a total of 15-20 key presses and wheel scroll events.  This simply sucks. Since I try to be polite and avoid phone interruptions during meetings, I wind up leaving the device on vibrate only, which means that occasionally I miss a call.RIM really needs to fix this. I can't imagine that anyone else has patented the idea of a \"mute\" switch....UPDATE, 2/10/07: The usability issues that I mentioned, plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me. My employer just added support for Windows Mobile devices, so I've replaced my 8700c with a Cingular 8525.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not bad... but one REALLY annoying design glitch", "unixReviewTime": 1160352000, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2006"}
