The best way to put it is...Love mine!, the point being that it takes a while to get used to it, but once you do, you get the unbeatable blackberry email and almost everything else you get in the iphone.The screen resolution and brightness is totally HD!I went for it over iphone as I needed the Blackberry email, calendar features etc. and now that I have it for a over a month or two, its hard to put it down. Am totally comfortable with typing as I don't need to email Grey's anatomy every day (it's a thick medical reference book:-)...you get the point.The way i look at it is that if your work environment is blackberry based, which i believe is true for most corporate environments, you'd certainly feel more comfortable with blackberry over iphone.For all rest, iphone may represent better value!Gave it four stars as RIM still has their work cut out on the software side, but don't be mislead by it, they seem to be on top of it and should have it sorted out soon.In the end, both devices represent great value, you need to work out what serves you better.
