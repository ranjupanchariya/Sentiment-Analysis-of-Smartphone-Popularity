I bought this for my Treo 650 and so far I'm very impressed. Battery life is great (about 10 hours), charges very quickly, and it's literally so light you forget you're wearing it. I also appreciate the addition of a PC USB charge cable for travelling lighter. Very nice addition for this price.I've only had it for a week and it is holding up well (you get a padded velcro carrying case too) but my initial impression, to be honest, was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it's very small and light. So I've been skeptical but we'll see how it goes and if I have to return it I'll modify my review.Pairing it up with the Treo 650 was fast and simple. It rings about 1 second after the phone rings also. The volume control on the unit is easy to use and can be turned up very loud. No complaints on the sound quality from anyone - my wife says it sounds a little like I'm on speakerphone but it's clear and understandable.Update: I had a chance to hear my wife using the headset finally and I'm very impressed - I think this headset is a keeper. There's virtually no background noise. I couldn't even tell that she was driving in the car. Absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.Update #2: This battery lasts forever - very impressed - and you really forget you're wearing this thing - it's that small and light!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm impressed so far", "unixReviewTime": 1172880000, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2007"}
