The phone is worth it. We have to manually set the back camera to 8 megapixels, setting it to 8 megapixels gives a way better shot than 13 megapixels. The only problem i faced was, whenever i set the sleep to 2 minutes or anything other than 30 seconds, it automatically reverts my changes, so not ablle to set sleep timer. The phone's screen becomes dirty easily as in comparison to moto g3. Moto g3 has a oleophobic coating, so it would repel oil, but this doesn't feature that. But still this phone is worth in it's price range.
