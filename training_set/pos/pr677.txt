This phone is beautiful, fast, and FUN to use.I switched from and iPhone.  I was worried I wouldnt find all my used apps... but you dont even need them with this phone!  The phone already does everything all my favorite apps did...But don't get me wrong, there are still TONS of apps in the market.. I just don't NEED them. :)It's so simple to use, but so advanced.  It practically does everything for you.  Brings information to your home screen.Facebook and twitter integration is seamless!The camera is PHENOMENAL.  Especially in low light conditions.Battery lasts me more than a day.-Couldnt be happier with my Lumia 920!
