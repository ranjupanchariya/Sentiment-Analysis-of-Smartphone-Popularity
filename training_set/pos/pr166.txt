Unarguably the best phone in the market in its price range....... Awesome camera, awesome display doesn't hang.... Cool options such as multi-tasking and a colourful music player make it a 5 star phone for me....without doubt....and trust me with the aluminium body that it has....it is LIGHT as hell..lightest among all the phones I've used up till now.
