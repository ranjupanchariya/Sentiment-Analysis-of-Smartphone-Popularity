I was hesitant to buy this phone because I'm not a fan of Microsoft, but the Lumia 521 appeared to be my best alternative after my phone suddenly died on me a couple of weeks ago while out of town.  As others have said, the phone is packed with features, which is totally surprising at this price point.  I downloaded quite a bit of music and podcasts and have only used my 5th Gen IPod a couple of times since my purchase, because this works so well.Pros:- Intuitive and responsive screen- Great storage, and expandable to 64 Gb- Good music player- There appear to be quite a few apps, including free ones (don't have much use for many apps)Cons:- I'm not a fan of the screen colors (maybe there's a way to change it?)- I searched for several hours online and there doesn't seem to be a way to connect my phone directly to my car like my IPod does.  I know I can use a line in cord, but I still nipped a star for it, because it's ridiculous that Microsoft hasn't done this for Windows smart phones.  I spend hours in my car every week listening to music and catching up on the many podcasts I listen to.  Hopefully, they will fix this soon.Review edited to add note:  this phone uses micro sim and micro SD cards.Great inexpensive phone!!
