I purchased a Plantronics CT12 8 years ago. It still works great and am even still using the original headset. I liked it so well I decided to get another one as close to like it as possible so I got the CT14 a few weeks ago. It works almost identical to the CT12 but has several improvements in programming functions that make it even easier to set up and use. So far it is working out great. I hope I can say that 8 years from now like I just said about the CT12. We are now using both phones. Why throw away the old one if it still works great.
