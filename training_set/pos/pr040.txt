I purchased this after I returned a N85-3 to another dealer, this phone has it all and works as good if not better than the old outdated N95-3.There are so many things to point out it would take me forever to put it all down but from a person that has owned a N73, Two N81's, a N78, a N95-2, Three N95-3's, Two N95-4's, a N85-3 and out of all of them the N96-3 is the best of all.If you would like the best Nokia that is being produced right now I would say pick up a N96-3,it works great and is really fun to use.
