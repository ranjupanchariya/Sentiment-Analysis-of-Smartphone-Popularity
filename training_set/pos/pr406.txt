I now can charge my iPhone and iPad easily while driving to and from work and have more security and more fun in my life.  My car has a 2 car chargers - I use this one in the console. It fits nicely in there.  This is aesthetically pleasing and seems well constructed. I had to read the reviews to figure out that A stands for Apple and NA for Non-Apple. This little, inexpensive device has made my life more comfortable.
