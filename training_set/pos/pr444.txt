The Nokia N8 is an excellent phone.It will take a couple of hours to figure out everything about how the phone works but once it's set up the phone offers the following features:- Multitasking: Once you set up all the icons, shortcuts and menus in the different customizable screens in the phone, you actually see how each application is working without affecting the phone performance. For example, you may be playing a song (and its application window shows song, controls, etc), then below that window you can have you email that updates as new email comes, in another window you can see your social media updates and activity on real time, etc. and the phone works like that in all applications.- Camera: Excellent picture quality in photos and video (12 M / 720 p)- Full customizable screens, icons, short cuts, menus, etc. No limits!- All 3G and GSM Bands possible- SIM LOCK FREE! This means, that when you travel internationally, you can buy a \"Pay as you go\" SIM Card and use the mobile phone locally (also to use wireless data and use Skype or any other application)- Many applications (productivity tools) that Apple and Android would sell you, are free in Nokia OVI- Great battery duration, excellent voice quality and very, very stable- Very productive phone: It gives you many options for any application, for example, it lets you choose what to do and how, for example, if you are going to play your music files, you can choose to transmit that music in FM to your car stereo, etc- HDMI output, so if you load a movie, video, etc. or simply watching videos from the phone, you can connect a HDTV monitor or TV straight from the phone!The only feed back that I have for Nokia is they need to update the Youtube application, of course, Nokia didn't developed it since Symbian is too open and independent developers can upload those applications, but besides that, it is in general terms....BETTER THAN iPhone 4: I have BOTH phones> iPhone 4 with AT&T; and Nokia N8 with T-Mobile....and guess which is more productive? Nokia!BTW: You know who uses my iPhone 4 instead? My kids just to play games...and I don't let them touch my Nokia :)I just hope Nokia won't destroy this freedom on their phone after Windows software comes. If I could get the Nokia N9 instead, it will be much better but I think I will try to but it in Australia in October 2011
