I really really like the phone. It comes with office and I can view my doc or ppt on it. even do some simple editing. Cam is decent especially for low light. Love Nokia navigation apps, they are really good since you can have your offline map and not using your data plan to do that.It has limited apps especially the popular ones or the one I rely on. I feel really bad about returning it...........When they have more app choice for WP I will definitely come back!
