The battery works as advertised. Lasts roughly 3x  longer than stock battery. I can make it through a day of heavy use at work including GPS  navigation, several phone calls (using Bluetooth),  Wi-Fi on,  data on,  maximum brightness,  frequent  emailing,  games,  internet,  etc.  and still have 50%-60%  juice remaining by the time I go to sleep. If you never want to worry about battery life again,  this product is for you.I give it 4  stars instead  of 5  because it is very heavy and large.  Gripping the phone is more difficult now.  However,  I am getting used to it and I do like the case that comes with it.
