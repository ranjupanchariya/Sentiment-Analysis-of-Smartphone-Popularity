Like the previous Motorola phones that I've had, this one has the easy intutive system for navigating its numerous menus --- I'm sold on using Motorola for this reason,  compared to the Noxxxx, Motorola is great!PROS:Almost everythingAwesome designGSMI found the volume to be excellent compared to my last phone (motorola v60).Good antenna, extremely low rate of dropped signals --- also, since the antenna does not protrude, I anticipate it will not require replacement (I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 --- broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping)Excellent color screen.Good camera for a phone.Great size, easily fits in a shirt pocket.Great battery life (with Bluetooth off)Easily customizable but items that I never use (media mall, media net, etc.) remain in a prominent place and can not be put in some obscure location.CONS:The most significant negative feature is the screen --- it is extremely hard to see in sunlight.Display on front (when closed) is hard to read.Price (if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular --- they wanted $199) However, since I was changing from AT&T; to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $70.The manual that comes with it should be better writen.Screen gets oily from normal use and must be wiped off frequently.Alarm Clock interface could be better.Date Book Alert is not very loud.Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor --- two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable (had to buy one at Wal-Mart).Of the four or five phones that I have owned, this one is by far the best in all respects.  Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star...  I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great.  PROBLEM:  After about 3 months the screen would not light up --- took the phone back to AT&T; and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month --- took that one back, they sent another reconditioned phone,  Long story > short:  I had 5 phones in one year, the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years.  Because of my experience with this phone, I will not buy another Motorola
