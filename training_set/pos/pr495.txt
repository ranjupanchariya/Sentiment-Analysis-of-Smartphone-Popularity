H/W quality is very good and eye catching design. ( though it is square) I would like to talk about OS. OS is very very user friendly eg 1) if you want check emails, whatsapp, texts, facebook msg etc think how screen taping needed on Android & IOS here you can see in only one swipe. 2) you will not find single person who says his phone is infected with virus or his credentials were stolen or hacked. 3) you can assign keys to application or dialing to contacts or system settings Eg long press P button would open pictures or M would open money control app etc 4) not only screen but keyboard is capacitive many more imp points to mention but I would suggest one to expirence Passport once instead of spending money on other dumb phones
