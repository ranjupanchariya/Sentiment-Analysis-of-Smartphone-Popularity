its soo goooooood... i wont review on tech basis ( see tech guru for that , rest only share experience of gadgets )Damn if its costly but its worth every bit of it.The display is mind blowing and utilities too...its a pure class and stands apart in the crowd of mobiles....BB again rocks with it and proves why mobile is mobile and not a display box....this is how u will use a mobile not to watch movies not to click pics but use it in real sense....and god its fast it never hanged ( i have been using my bros set for three days and have experiment about every thing and that too heavly ) ..............if only its qwerty keypad was as good as ever i would have given 5 stars .....and rest i am selling my old bike for this.
