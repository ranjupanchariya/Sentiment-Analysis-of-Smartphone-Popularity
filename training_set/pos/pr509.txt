I bought this phone form a local store , it cost less than what flipkart set its price. Talking about the build quality , its very good and charming. What i like the most is its cameras, both are 2 MP with flash , and supports 480p video recording. Battery backup is one of the best in this phone.The display is good but according to my view it is not enough strong as like other nokia devices in this price segment The thing i m disappoint is that its app support, the facebook app in .this phone is not the facebook app as in the other java phones in nokia, it just opens a link in opera browser. The opera app store is lack of many essential app such as UC browser, fb app etc. After all its good but not the best as i hoped it.
