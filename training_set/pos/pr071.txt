I've been using Blackberries since a blackberry was thought to be something you would find in a muffin. The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.
