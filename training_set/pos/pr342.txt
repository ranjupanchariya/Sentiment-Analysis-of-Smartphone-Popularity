 am very happy with this phone. It has some unnecessary features that perhaps I'll appreciate more once I learn them better, but for now they are fun just for the novelty aspect. The phone is an excellent size, very light, great screen res. and very fast/responsive. I was also very impressed with the battery life! I was able to take a weekend trip with the WiFi and Bluetooth on and I only had to charge it on the drive there and back (which meant almost 2 full days)!
