Go for it if you are looking for good camera, good battery backup and the phone which does not heat up.I was confused between redmi note 3, LE eco,moto g4 plus and honor 5c.I decided to go for honor 5c n I think i made best choice. Moto g4 plus is good but there is much price gap between honor 5c n moto.This is my first honor phone and it is really great. Other phones may have big numbers and specifications but numbers does not always reflect the actual performance.Go for this without any doubt.Also thanks to flipkart for on time delivery.
