if you turn the phone on without a sim card, then once you put in the sim you have to do a factory data reset otherwise you will only be able to use edge, even with the correct APN settings.edge =  ~200kbpsHSPA+ = ~7000kbpsAPN settings:Name: AT&T; (this doesn't really matter)APN: wap.cingularUsername: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COMPassword: CINGULAR1MMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410APN type: internet + mmsall others can be left blank.As far as the phone goes, it's totally awesome! drawing stuff is really fun and reading long web pages is no longer annoying.
