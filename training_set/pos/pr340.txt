What is not to like when you get a $700 phone for a penny just for adding a new line.  If you have a phone about ready to go off contract, then buy this phone and put it on as a second or additional line.  You can always suspend service on the other phone when it expires.  Renewal was $50 to $200 depending if you go online or at the Verizon store.  Store is always more expensive, or you can go to Walmart and get it for $50.
