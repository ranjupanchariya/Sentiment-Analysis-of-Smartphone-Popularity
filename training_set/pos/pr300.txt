T-Mobile and Nokia should be proud of this phone: on the T-Mobile network, it is the best basic smart phone you can buy.Lots of folks want a small, light, durable and easy to use phone at an affordable price. They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email. They don't care about 3D action games or downloading dozens of apps.The 521 is a great phone for basic use. If you live in a city with T-Mobile's 4G HSPA service your emails will download rapidly (check the coverage map at the T-Mobile website BEFORE buying).If you just want to send text messages and read your email, a $600 phone is a waste of money. The Nokia Lumia 521 is perfect for your needs. And, it is nice looking. The new Iphone 5c has colorful back covers... Apple noticed the 521 (and its popularity) and \"borrowed\" its style.By the way, T-Mobile now owns MetroPCS. Both the 521 and prepaid service for it cost less at MetroPCS stores than anywhere else. Just $49 or $29 after rebate until March 1st.
