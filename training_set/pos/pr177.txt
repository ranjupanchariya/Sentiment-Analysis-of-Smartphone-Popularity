I purchased the black version of this phone from Mobile store.The first thing which I felt with the handset in my hand was WOW!!!Prior to the purchase,I had compared almost all the brands like Intex,XOLO,Gionee giving the same features such as FHD,1.5 ghz processor,2 GB Ram,13 MP camera.But the look and feel of MMX Turbo is far better than other brands.
The battery needs to be charged once everyday which is not a issue.The camera takes crisp pictures in full light and a little grainy in low light.Smooth gaming experience.No lags in touch.I would highly recommend this product.
