I just bought this phone after the keys kept sticking on my Curve. I had read all the bad reviews and decided to try it anyway--with Verizon you have 30 days to try it and return if you don't like.  I have to say I love this phone!  Right out the box from Verizon it had the older OS on it, even though the rep told me was up to date.  No big deal, took me 30 minutes or less to download .148, the new OS.  I have seen none of the lag problems that people complain about.  The camera takes awesome pics, and the larger screen is crystal clear.  I am already getting better with the touch screen.  My brother has the iPhone and said even on that it took him a few weeks to get used to typing on it.  Would I consider the iPhone if my work email was compatible?  Maybe.  But I am more than satisfied with the Storm after a week of using it!  I definitely would recommend it.
