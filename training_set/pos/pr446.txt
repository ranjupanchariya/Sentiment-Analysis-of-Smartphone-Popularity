The N8 is the perfect phone for me. I travel often and usually take an iPod, small notebook computer and camera with me. Now I have my N8--it does it all! The music player works well and the camera is the best I've seen on a phone; it has great editing tools and it can be used with an HDTV. I can access my email, browse the web and IM family and friends; all from my phone. It switches to WiFi whenever available so you don't have charges from your phone carrier. The manual is well written and easy to follow (I printed a copy and put in a 3-ring binder for easy reference). I had no trouble setting the phone up initially. The free maps, GPS and navigation system are great for traveling all over the world. Because it is an unlocked phone, I can switch SIM cards and change carriers in the USA or get a local country SIM when traveling internationally. The OVI suite is easy to use, allows you to easily update your contacts/calendar, the OVI web site offers great support and many apps to download for free and to purchase, and the OVI Music works seamlessly to make playlists and sync to your phone. There are several private web sites which also offer support and products for the N8. I plan on keeping this phone for a while and I feel it is a great value
