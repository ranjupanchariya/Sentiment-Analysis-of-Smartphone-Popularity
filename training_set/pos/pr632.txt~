Only 5k !!!! First of all I have to say one should not hesitate to purchase it when he wants the volte mobile or wants to use jio sim ....when you follow the review list you should not be misguided by some harsh critics who rated negative regarding intex aqua 5.5 vr ..I want to mention after using seven days that battery back up is excellent .. ram is 1 gb but speed is almost good ..does not hang ..touch is not bad.. moreover virtual reality box with 3d effect!! ..overall set is just amazing ....my samsung on set is good volte set but I have to pay double that time ...when you have 7k in hand to purchase a volte then go for redmi 3s if more then go for better brands otherwise intex vr 5.5... I also think that vr 5.5 set is a step of Intex authority to regain the brand value ..
