Everyone one can justify the design and features instantly but not performance, over a period of usage only it can be justified. This review is all about the performance after 8 months of usage.Except battery (5Hrs approx. with 2 3G Sims - Moderate usage), everything else is fine.There are no hangings while using the phone.
