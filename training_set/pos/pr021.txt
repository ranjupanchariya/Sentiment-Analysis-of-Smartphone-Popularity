I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price.  (...)  Can't beat it on value.
