I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 just a few weeks ago. I originally put on an OtterBox case (trying to be extra careful) but I have to admit that I really disliked it. It made my already large phone double in size. Yuk.This case is great! Although it is two color, it is a solid case. The black and white are crisp and clean looking - very professional. All ports are open and clear, charging is not an issue and there is a extra rim around the screen so that you have a little added protection when your phone is face down. My phone is 2.75\" wide and with this case it is 3\". Which means that it adds an eighth of an inch on either side. Compared that to an OtterBox which adds a quarter inch on each side (a total of \" to the width of your phone.)I'm sure if I dropped it the right way, my screen would crack. Without having a huge case on, there is only one way to avoid this: don't drop your phone. The corners are reinforced on the inside. I've posted a photo in customer images to show this.The buttons on the side (power and volume) are really responsive and don't take a lot of pressure to function.The finish is very smooth with a little rubbery resistance. Just enough tension to hold it easily in your hand but not so much that it is difficult to pull out of a pocket or purse.Thule is a brand I'm familiar with because we use one of their kayak roof racks. It is a quality company that has a great reputation.
