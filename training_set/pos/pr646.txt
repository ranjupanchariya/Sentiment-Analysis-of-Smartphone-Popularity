his phone is the best in this range but unfortunately flipkart delivered me a defected piece. I asked for refund so they send me their engineer to check if the product is actually defected. Their technician checked and told me that refund shall be made shortly. 30 minutes later someone from flipkart called me and said that the refund cannot be processed as their technician told them it is not defected. Now I am left with pathetic phone is my hand and these guys are not doing anything.
