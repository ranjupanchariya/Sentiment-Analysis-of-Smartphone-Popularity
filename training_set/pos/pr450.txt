I'm very happy with this phone.  I've been a fan of the N-series for a while, having previously owned the N95 and the N96.  The transition to touchscreen has been pleasant and effortless.  I thought I would miss the physical buttons, but I don't.  I have learned how to \"Swype\".  I like that there are so many apps for this phone in the OVI store.  I have all my music loaded onto my phone, so I have plenty to listen to while I'm at work.  The builtin GPS is very good, seems to find a signal much quicker than my previous N-series phones.  Battery life is excellent.  I would recommend this phone
