 Good sound quality for each side of the conversation.  Good battery life, easy recharging, simple to use.  Basically perfect except for my cons..Cons:  Huge blinking blue light is annoying at night and invisible during the day.  Sometimes it take a second for it to answer a call when you click the answer button.  I guess the solution for that is probably to wait a few seconds after answering before saying \"hello\".  This flaw also demonstrates itself when using VZ Navigator, because it cuts off the first word of driving instructions.  This flaw might be from my MOTOKRZR phone and not from the T305, but I don't have any way to know which end causes it.Another reviewer stated that the \"on/off\" button is too small.  When I first read that, I didn't know why it matters.  I now know.  At least with a MOTOKRZR (and I'd assume other phones), the speaker on your phone will be inactive when it is connected via Bluetooth to your T305.  With 150 feet of range, it actually stays connected if you are 150 feet from your car.  Therefore you have to turn it off every time you get out of the car, or else you won't be able to hear calls you receive on your phone.  It isn't a huge deal, and something you can get used to, but Motorola should have either made the on/off button more accessible or cut the Bluetooth range down to about 15 feet.Overall the best handsfree solution for talking in the car.  The light thing is my biggest annoyance.  I would buy again.
