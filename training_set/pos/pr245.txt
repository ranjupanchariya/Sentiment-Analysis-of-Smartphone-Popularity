After using Samsung's Galaxy S2 this phone was much better. Camera quality, sound quality was almost equal but capacitive touch and body builty were great. Dual sim works really good. Only problem with this phone was that available application ram is only 1 so I have to remove other applications which I am not using to install new ones or to upgrade previous installed apps.
