I'm a heavy Ingress player, so that means I am running GPS, mobile data, and screen-on for hours at a time, and occasionally wifi and bluetooth as well. After having tried several extended batteries on a couple of different Android Devices, I have to say the ZeroLemon 7000mAh is the clear winner.  I can go an entire day on my Galaxy S3 without having to plug my phone in, and if I forget to charge it at night, it's not a crisis the next morning. That may not seem long, but Ingress is a real battery killer. I rarely need my external battery anymore with this setup. More typical users might get two or three days on a single charge.I was also surprised that the included case/cover is actually quite nice, with a good smooth feel and a texture that doesn't slip. I previously had an Anker 4400 battery with a Laza RuggedFusion case. This is 150% more battery and the case has as slimmer profile while still offering decent protection. I'ts not an otterbox-grade, but still is reasonably thick and has a protective riser around the screen edge to prevent cracks. I have dropped the phone once or twice with this case, and there hasn't been any damage as far as I can determine.
