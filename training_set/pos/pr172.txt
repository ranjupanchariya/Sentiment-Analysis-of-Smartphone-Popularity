I purchased this product about 4 months back. Phone looks really awesome. Build is good and sleek. Only problem is voice quality is low. Sometimes I am not able to hear other person clearly. Battery gives on an average 24hours backup with moderate use. Apps never lag. Gaming is also good.And flipkart service is as usual up to the mark. :)Cheers...!!!!!
