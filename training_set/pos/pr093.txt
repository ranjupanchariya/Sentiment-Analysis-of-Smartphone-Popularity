I've had the phone for six months and am completely satisfied.  I'm amazed at the number or featuresin this small package. All the features work as advertised except the FM transmitter in my 4Runner, probably because the car's antenna is, I believe, in the back glass.  I moved up from a n75 which had terrible battery life; the N85 is, maybe,five times better.On a side note, I dropped the phone and it would no longer charge.  I thought the phone was outof warranty, but on calling NokiaUSA to see about getting it repaired, it wasn't.  They immediatelyeMailed me a UPS shipping label and directions.  I took the bare phone to a UPS store and they tookit packaged it and sent it on its way.  One week later a new phone showed up at my door. No money out of my pocket. In the future I'll need a real good reason to buy any other brand of phone.  Also, the replacement's fit is about the same.  That is to say, there is a small amount of play in the slider parts.Of course, there has to be some play for parts to slide under different temperature conditions.I don't find this a problem.
