I am using the Canvas turbo form 3 month now and the journey so far has been smooth with some odd glitches appearing some times. E.g. it hanged couple of times in past three months and I have re-start the phone both times. And once its speaker had stopped working and again I have to restart it to make it work.Apart from that Camera is great, screen resolution is also great. I liked the overall looks too.
