This is very cool and easy way to charge your bold. Comes in handy for watching videos, listening to music and using the speaker phone. Also if you use the bedside mode or use you bold as alarm clock this is perfect for you. Keep in mind though this is basically just a simple stand for the bold it doesnt come with any extra cables or wires. Also cant be used to sync your bold with your pc. It doesnt exactly hold the bold very tight and so its very easy to knock your bold over when its in the cradle. Lastly you cant use this cradle with a case. This accessorie is over priced considering what it does. If you can get it for $15 or less then only is it really worth it.
