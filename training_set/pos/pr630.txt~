m giving this review after constant use of mobile data and live streaming. I watched movies, serials and did too many surfing activities using the phone with jio card. Cant believe that there is NO HEATING ISSUE AT ALL ... and hats-off to the awesome battery backup. I relly dont know Y we indians are not promoting our brands and going crazy behind CHINESE HOT BOXES. I have too much bad experiences with all Chinese brands say from MI, coolpad to Leeco. And also look at the price range... IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE!!!!!!!!!!
