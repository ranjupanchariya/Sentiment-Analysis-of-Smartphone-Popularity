The review has to be in 2 parts 1 on flipkarts delivery and 2 on the product.About delivery I just cant quibble, It was spot on within 24 hours. It gave me the same feeling as if I had gone to buy something from the market and brought it home myself.About the phone, it is a good refreshment over all the androids and iphones for a change which are all almost same.Size, I have no issues with it being square. I am not into gaming etc, so while reading seeing more words per row is a relief.But it has issues, and the biggest one is, "apps", though you can sideload, which I eventually did but one needs to figure out how to.Next is battery, when u read 3450mah it sounds great, but I dont know why, battery seems to drain a lot more faster and it turns up as a 1800mah or so phone.Third, which I did read before buying, was the "heating" issue, which is quite prominent when GPS is turned on
