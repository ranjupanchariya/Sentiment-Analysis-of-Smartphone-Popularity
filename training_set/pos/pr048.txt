I've been using Treos since they first came out (I think I started with a Treo 180) and so I have to admit that switching to a Windows Mobile device left me feeling uneasy.  But I couldn't wait for the Pre as my 680 started crapping out on me and I didn't want a 700/750/800.  However, since I have been syncing my Palm with Outlook for years, the data transfer was pretty seamless.  Naturally I had to redo my speed dials and I couldn't load some of my favorite games, but I knew that going in.  The device is definitely of Treo pedigree, however, and the form factor is a significant improvement. Compatibility with the MS Office suite is a plus (no more dependence on Data Viz).  The device had a lot of menus and was difficult to navigate (kind of like all of the other Windows software I've ever used) but I read a review on the device that mentioned installation of SPB Mobile Shell and that has helped tremendously; it should be the first piece of software that you install!  I also like the unlocked GSM, integrated GPS and the WiFi (all of these were selling points for the phone and worked perfectly out of the box).  Nice job Palm!  Can't wait to see the Pre come out in an unlocked version :-D
