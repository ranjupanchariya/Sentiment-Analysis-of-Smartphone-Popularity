The phone is awesome. If you want a thorough review please visit YouTube. This phone will transform the way You think you work you manage time. It is something only a BB user will appreciate.If you want  a style statement and want to show everyone a half bitten piece of fruit logo then of course you can go for the 90k phone but if you want productivity then this is the one for you. I went for this phone despite of the fact that bbs does not have a service outlet to cover warranty in india buy having used the Curve Bold  knew that I would never have to visit that awful place ever In my life.Yes apps are limited but If you are smart enough you will figure out a way to make all apps work on a bb.The camera is good. Pretty good I should say. And its a phone. That's what a phone is supposed to do. Point and shoot. If you are looking for digital stabilisation with slow mo and crystal something something with something something please buy the passport and spend the remaining budgets of the fruit on a dslr.I also own a Galaxy s4 for the Android platform and yes there are some limitations If you compare an android and a BB interface. For example. You cant remote control your home pc from a blackberry for that you need an android. The VR things won't work on a bb for that you need an android. but if you want a fast phone that can multitask seamlessly and is known for its security then bb Is the one. S4 is also an awesome phone. Have been using it since 2012 and still works like a charm. Wanted to go for the note 7 as well along with the Passport but then Diwali arrived and I had already bought actual fireworks. Desperately waiting for the next best thing Samsung has to offer. Its another company hell bent on innovation and smart thinking.BB never advertised saying my phone is waterproof My phone is waterproof Screaming my phone is waterproof but before buying I just browsed the net for the same and I won't say anything you Check it out yourself.I specifically searched the net for nearly 15 days for bad reviews for the Passport. Prime reason being no warranty support. But I could not find even a single review until one day. I found one saying Passport Sucks.and go to see it was sarcastically portrayed to indulge fools like me Who were desperate to find any negative reviews.You will actually rethink what innovation is once you start using the Passport. Please check a thorough review on you tube.And finally for the first time in my life even after a full day use from 9 am to 9 pm i can sleep in peace thinking ya the battery is only 70 percent I can charge it tomorrow evening.Oh. Almost forgot. This phone supports 4g but international frequency of 4g. in India the frequency is I guess 1800 mhz or something which it does not support for 4g. So please check with your carrier for 4g support for the  bb passportif you are a 4g maniac . Otherwise I am fine using this phone with 3g. As it is we are not a completely 4g enabled country.Ironically BlackBerry is also a Fruit. but the screen ppi of this fruit is better than any other fruit or vegetables or teddy bears or the milky way.
