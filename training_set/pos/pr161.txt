What a phone? Just got the device. Simply superb in looks. Who all are complaining about 2000mAh battery, just dont speak before using the device. Everyone complained when Canvas 4 came with 1GB RAM. But my friend has it and played tons of apps simultaneously.NO lags. And this time also, they have optimized the battery. It LASTS AROUND 1 and Half day with medium to heavy usage. MMX Rocks and what a gem of a device. AND THOSE WHO ALL HAVE VOTED 1 STAR, BEWARE READERS, they are anti-MMX biased who just dont know what MMX has provided us for 19k. One person said he would go for S3. I moved on from S3 to Canvas TURBO. AWESOME.
