I've always been an apple user but had the opportunity to try this phone by Nokia recently. The Lumia 928 is a smart looking Windows Phone. I do prefer the iphone, BUT everyone has their personal preferences. The phone seems great and worked great - but I still prefer my apple products.That said, I'm basing the review on the product itself and not my personal likes/dislikes.The Lumia 928 works on the Windows Phone 8 operating system. It worked smooth and fast and very responsive as well. You can customize just about everything with this phone, the look, size and color of things and the tiles as well. And all change with easy. I like how the live tiles update and all your info is right there on the screen to your preference. The display is the AMOLED display and makes the screan sharp and clear and works nice even in the sunlight. The screen is 4.5 inches which is a decent size.The camera works well in daylight or even low light. It also has a flash which is pretty decent as well. It can record in HD 1080p with noise canceling as well. Call quality is also good, calling and receiving and the speaker on the phone works clear and your able to hear the person as well. It can run on the 4G network and comes with 32 GB of internal storage- I wish it had more but for most users this is plenty of space. Or at least added in external storage or such.Battery life is decent and it has a pretty neat feature where it can charge wireless! The battery is not removable but lasts about 13 hours of talk time.Like many smartphones there are a ton of Apps available.. many say there are more on OS, and Android, but non the less there are many apps. There is no swype keyboard for those that prefer this.Smart Looking Windows 8 Phone, Works Well, Many Features
