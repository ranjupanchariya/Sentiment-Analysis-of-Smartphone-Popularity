I bought this phone on May 2014 and till now I dint face even a single issue on it.Only the phone gets heated up while using GPS. Even in using 3G it does gets heated like other phones that gets heated just by using 3G for 1 hour.The battery lasts long. The touch is awesome.Nothing to complain about
