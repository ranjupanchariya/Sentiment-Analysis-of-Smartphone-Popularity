Short & Sweet REVIEW :)I've had my S4 for about 2 weeks now and LOVING it! I got my 2 year upgrade from my Droid Bionic and of course it exceeds all my expectations from my previous phone.Screen is GORGEOUS and processor is FAST! I really like the voice command and air view settings, too. Battery life IMO is comparable to all the other phones out there. I use the power saving setting and turn off the gps & bluetooth when I don't need them. No problems with linking bluetooth and speaker phone is great. Speakers are loud without muffling.My favorite thing about Android platforms is that you can customize your screens to which apps you use frequently and the addition of widgets as well. Not to mention a lot of the popular apps that are free!Everyone that complains about the plastic back-WHATEVER. 99% of you guys will get a protective case so that complaint is null and VOID. Anyone who doesn't get a protective case for a $150+ investment in my opinion deserves for their phone to get damaged or uses the bathroom on a 24 karat toilet....lucky you if you do.Yes, the screen is gorilla glass (aka tempered glass for the one's not impressed with the new name to enhance sales) but like I said, to protect my investment wisely I've opted for the Spigen Glasst nano slim protector and case which are both very complimentary to my new S4.SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Screen Protector Glass Slim [GLAS.t NANO SLIM] (0.15mm) Thin Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Protective [Neo Hybrid] [Infinity White] Slim Fit Dual Protection Cover for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500
