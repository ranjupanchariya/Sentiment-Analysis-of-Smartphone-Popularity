This phone was clearly made for Windows 8. The OS is as seamlessly integrated with this phone as APple's OS is with the iPhone. Windows 8--especially the mobile edition-- is a lot to digest for new users but the learning curve is not too steep if you are willing to invest the time. The call quality is clear, the picture quality is clear and the system seems fast and not buggy. Overall you can't go wrong if you are looking for a Windows 8 phone. 5/5 stars.
