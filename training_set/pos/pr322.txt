I have found this phone so easy to learn. Even easier than some of the older flip style \"dumb\" phones I've had over the years. Everything is so intergrated, and smooth. Camera is phenom, and the wireless charging is super cool! I come home, lay the phone on the charging pad, and that's it! Even with Windows Phone Apps store being behind Android and ios, there are WAY more apps than I could ever download. All the top apps are there. Very satisfied!
