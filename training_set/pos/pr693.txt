I had the N75 about two weeks and here is my report:o I find the loose-fitting lid an irritant.  Maybe other(')s don't.o Mine doesn't make any funny internal sounds.o Mine doesn't get hot.o Mine doesn't drop calls.o No stero bluetooth.o Mine seems to do a good job of voice recognition.o It bluetooths to my Moto H500 quickly, and the voice recognition worksfine there also.o The surface does soak up finger prints.o The display screens are spectacular.o I like the large buttons on the key pad.o Large screen, large buttons = large phone, I guess.o The battery goes flat pretty fast (one day), but I'm constantlyplaying with the phone.  Maybe when the newness wears off, It'lldo better.o The pop-port is a pain; also, they should have put it on the topor bottom.o Transferring pictures, music and application using the pop-portis a breeze.  It's quicker than screwing with the microSD.o Speaker are loud enough.o Being able to load different application is neat.o The pictures seem plenty sharp for a 2 Mega-pixel. If you blow themup, they become pixelated (see submitted pictures).o I'm going to keep it and hope for a battery solution, or learn tolive with it.
