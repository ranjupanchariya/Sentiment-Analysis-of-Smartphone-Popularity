I never thought I would own a Blackberry.  In fact, I first bought a Nokia e71.  The Symbian OS was not user friendly and nothing like the standard Nokia OS.The Blackberry Bold 9000 is very user friendly and the UI is intuitive.  Call quality and the speaker phone is very good.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a PDA.
