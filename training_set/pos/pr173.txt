It is very good to use it in the beginning when it is new. It is fast and is definitely a very good phone for its cost. Display and touch are also very good. Battery life is not very long but is decent enough. It comes for more than two days on battery when I don't play games on it.Main problem is that it gets heated up. You cannot hold it in your hand for a long time while playing games. This is one big issue because it just doesn't warm but hot(nearly as hot as a dell old laptops do get :P ). It bricks(happened to my phone twice) sometimes and you will not have anything to do except to wait for the battery to get discharged and then restart your phone.On a whole it is a good phone for its price but does work as well as you would expect it to after seeing its specs. It is better to take a blue one than the white one. On the white phone you cannot see the notification LED properly because it is of light green color. Black one also looks better than the white one.
