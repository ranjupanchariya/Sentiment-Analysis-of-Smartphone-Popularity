This is an amazing phone and a great value.  Windows Phone is a smooth, seamless operation, and this was the original flagship for Windows Phone 8.  It still hold up fine- excellent screen, spacious keyboard, and useful tools.  From Kids Corner (which allows parents to set up a kid friendly portion of their phone), Rooms (allows users to share posts, calanders and events), Mobile Office and top end music and mapping services built in.  You just cannot go wrong.  Easy to set up, learn,and personalize.  I cannot endorse this enough.
