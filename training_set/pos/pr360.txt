I had given up on Android after the Moto X. Android was glitchy and iOS just seemed snappier and easier to use. When the Galaxy S4 came out, I had to try it out. Coming from an Iphone 5, I was very skeptical. But this phone definitely give the Iphone a run for it's money. It feels just as thin as the Iphone 5, but lighter. I thought having a huge phone was going to bother me because I usually carry my phones in my pocket, but it's no bother at all. I love all the features like the air gestures and the multiple windows. Don't get me wrong, the Iphone 5 is an awesome phone, but Samsung is getting better and better. Very impressed
