I purchased the Blackberry Bold 9000 in hopes of a great smartphone that would work out well with my prepaid phone plan. Well, this phone came in a protected package, no damage at all, worked great upon first time installing my sim card and memory card.  Contacts and all switched right over to the Blackberry from my sims card and I was able to read everything stored on my memory chip. I wanted to learn more about the phone and remembered the tutorial, then I added some free apps to the phone. With all of the adventures that I have taken this phone on I can honestly say no problems at all, great purchase for an awesome price. Very recommendable.
