 am a Samsung fan...and this phone just builds on my opinion.  I did seriously consider switching to an iPhone when I changed carriers, but after spending some quality hands-on time with iPhones belonging to friends, I stuck with Samsung.  I love the Galaxy series; I've owned the  II and  III, and now the IV.I'm happy with my phone and happy I switched from Sprint to Verizon.
