The N85 takes the best pictures I have ever seen on a phone, as well as the best video. The sound quality on a good pair of headphones is top-notch as well. The call quality is pretty good, and reception is better than average. The FM transmitter works well only if the channel you're using has no signals near it in frequency, but when in my car i use the auxiliary input instead. Another welcome surprise was the internet radio quality, which lets me stream music mostly uninterrupted. INternet is speedy on 3G, but flies on a wi-fi network. Tethering is also possible with the right circumstances.With any new phone, there are bound to be bugs, but this phone has been out for over 6 months, and still has buggy software. The phone sometimes freezes during music playback, and unfreezes only when slid open or closed. The audio switches from headphone to speakerphone when you get a message, which can be quite annoying. The video recording sometimes freezes, a problem caused apparently by fragmentation on the microSD card. If you can put up with those issues, then this phone will work well for you.Some other notes. The slider has some give, and makes the phone feel a bit flimsy, but I have dropped it once with no repercussions. Purchase a good pair of headphones, and IMMEDIATELY apply an invisishield cover to protect from scratches, to which the N85 is quite prone.Also, do NOT install the Nokia software suite unless you have to, as it will run a process on your pc which will slow your pc way down. Simply hooking the N85 to a pc running Vista or XP lets you do most of the things you need to flawlessly, including syncing with windows media player, and uploading pictures and video.
