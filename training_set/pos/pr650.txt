Looks is good. Front facing speaker but little quiet though. Battery lasts more than a day. User memory 3.71 GB. Ram is free about 400 MB. Headphone sound is very low in volume. But problem solved by adjusting equalizer. Bundled headphone is not good. If you want good sound then use a good headphone. Has a notification light. Battery charging is very slow. takes almost 4.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100 percent. Not faced any hanging or heating issue. Lots of unnecessary software are installed by default. But there is option to move apps to memory card, though not all applications. Call quality is good. VoLTE is supported and wors fine with Jio sim. Overall a good phone at this price point. You can go for it if you compromise the cons which are not big issues.\
