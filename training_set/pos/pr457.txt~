Well, It is an excellent product, mainly it is due to the screen (relatively large), very very responsive, Android es very fast and good, Motoblur do the things easy and organized, \"BUT\" I cannot turn on 3G, I bought also Nokia C5-03 that runs on the same 3G bands this phone and it works perfect. But this does not happen with the Motorola, which gives me just Edge signal. Maybe because,,, maybe it is not totally unlocked, it is a phone from Orange, with a good 2G, Edge Reception but impossible to turno on the 3G.My Web PAGE (...)
