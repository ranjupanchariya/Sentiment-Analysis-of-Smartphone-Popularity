I got the Nokia Lumia 928 because I really wanted to try out the windows 8 phone. I switched from the apple iPhone to this. I've also owned several android phones. I am very impressed with the quality of the pictures and videos with this phone. The clarity of the screen is amazing! I also love the color and how sleek this phone looks as well. Every time I use this phone in front of people, I get asked a thousand questions. I even got an offer for someone to purchase it from me. There is no chance that I would ever let go of this phone right now. I love how fast it is and the clarity is amazing.The one thing that disappointed me with this phone is that there are some apps that I used on my iPhone and androids that weren't available for the windows 8 phone, most of them were the ones that I downloaded for my grandson. If I was out with him, and I had to wait in line for any long period of time, I would just give him the phone and let him play with some of the games, and it would keep him occupied so he wouldn't be running all over the place. Other then that, the camera on this phone is amazing, and it out shines both i phones and android phone as well.
