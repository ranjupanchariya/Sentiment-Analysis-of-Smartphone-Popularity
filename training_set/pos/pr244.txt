I bought this phone two months ago.....after doing lots of research i have bought this phone for 15k ....... the device is amazing in terms of speed & running of applications . I am playing temple run 2, candy crush, & subway surfer without any lags. Bateerry life is like other smart phones it works for 1 full day and if you install battery saver then you can increase it too. I am using it for whatsapp, facebook, linkedin , skype & emailing purpose. The camera clicks wonderful images and it is having picture editing options too. Overall a wonderful Phone and I am fully satisfied it..... going to buy another peice for wife too......
