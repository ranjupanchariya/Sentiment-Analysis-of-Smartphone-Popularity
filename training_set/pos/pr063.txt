I have bought this phone from Amazon twice. The first time I just could not get past the size of the thing. I thought I was going to drop it. I felt like my hand was cramping due to trying to hold it for long lengths of time. I have bought it a second time (Global is the BEST!)This time I bought an Otterbox case which gives a good secure \"handhold.\" I also got the Samsung pen assembly which takes the tiny S-Pen and actually makes it a useful device. Those two things made all the difference in the world! With a full sized pen you will use it all the time.I no longer automatically reach for my beloved Samsung SII. It will be sold. It seems so tiny now.The Note is the real deal.(PS. Running this on $45 a month Straight Talk with HSPA speed and excellent coverage when traveling...even in the notorious Dead Zone in Gulf Coast Mississippi.)I could not be happier.
