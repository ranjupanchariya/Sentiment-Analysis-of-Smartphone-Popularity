I just got my BlackBerry Passport couple of days back and I absolutely love it.When I first opened the box, I was flabbergasted with the unique size and shape of the device and immediate thought was, how on earth would I carry it around. But just few minutes after, got used to it.The initial setup was a cake walk [I have used BB 10.3 OS before) since I have a Blackberry Z30 and Z10 that I use.I have fully charged the device, and infact, I literally forgot about charging the device alteron as the powerful battery that comes with this device is amazing. It lasts for more than a day [Heavy usage with 3G data/WiFi always turned on].I'm really loving this beast
