I didn't like T-Mobile but wanted to keep my old number without going through porting, so I went with this as a prepaid phone. It's really nice. The white shell can be changed easily. The screen is quite nice, way better than the screens you get on similarly priced Android phones. The system is easy to use and very fast, never crashes. I love it amazingly high quality especially at this price
