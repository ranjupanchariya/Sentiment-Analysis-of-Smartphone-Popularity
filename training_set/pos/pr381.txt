If you want good phone capabilities and email, then this is the phone for you.  I have had many smart phones which had a camera, MP3 player, ability to do excel, etc and found these phones to be slow and inferior to the Blackberry.  While it takes a little while getting used to it, once you do, it is a much faster device than any other phone for emailing and texting
